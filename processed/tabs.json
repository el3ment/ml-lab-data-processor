this is the most accurate of the bunch. The G7 in the first line of the last verse should be Gmaj7. There are a lot of opportunities to do some smooth chord transitions/minimal finger movements. As an example, try using the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers for the first D of the verses, then playing the Bm6 as x20132. Or playing the Bm to D7 as x2x232 (Bm7) then xx0212 (D7). Or Gmaj7 (3x0002) to Gm6 (3x0330) to D/F# (2x023x) to Bm7 (x2x232) to Em7 (020030 or 02x030).<br><br>The intro should read as a measure of D then Gm6/D, then a measure of D then G/D and D. The intro lays well to play the D as as mini barre chord using the 1st finger across the top three strings with the 2nd finger playing the 3rd fret of the B string then playing the Gm6 that follows as xx0353 and moving that mini barre from the 2nd fret for the D to the 3rd fret with the pinky on the 5th fret of the B string. Then, after the same mini barre D as the third chord of the intro, play the G/D as xx0334 using the 3rd finger on high E string and the 4th finger on the G string, and then pulling the 3rd and 4th fingers off for a return to the mini barre D chord. The variation is to do the G/D as xx0787 to D as xx0775.</p>,<p class=\"mtop5\">Tried to give this 5 stars and will try one more time, if the limitations of Ultimate Guitar's postings allow it.</p>",

"<p class=\"mtop5\">I'm always amazed and thankful for the work musicians do to post their versions on Ultimate Guitar.<br><br>I first voted 5-star (excellent) for this posting, then changed my rating to 4-star (accurate) ... sorry.<br><br>One of the biggest reasons people like me come on to this site is to get printable versions of a song.  The more complete, the better it is for users.  Your version and your work didn't write the chords for ALL of the song.  It would better if it was complete.</p>,<p class=\"mtop5\">Ok...lazy on my part.  I have just posted the \"whole\" song...<br>Thanks for the heads up...<br>Pencom<br>Set8</p>,<p class=\"mtop5\">Pencom's version here is the best existing tab of this song on this site: nice and sweet and also complete (the others are often missing parts and aren't well formatted). Still, it is sort of a version for easy guitar. When I was looking for a tab of this song, this one sounded well enough but I thought there are some part missing - intro and other interludes, too. So I sat down and ear-transcribed Billy Joel's recording. My tab, however, wasn't accepted when I submitted it (too many bad versions already up; a good one was considered to be one too many, I guess). I'm sure, though, other people could be interested in what I found out.

Thank you for taking the time to tab it out. </p>,<p class=\"mtop5\">hey man, great chord-melody... i just have two suggestions:<br><br>i think every second time it goes to that Cadd9 chord, you have a typo.  i don't think that (x 3 x 0 2 0) is what you want, i think you want to repeat the (x 3 0 3 0) instead.  it sounds much better.  the C# really clashes with the C in the first chord, and there's no theoretical purpose for it.<br><br>secondly, i would suggest adding an A to the implied V chord at the end of each phrase-- the one that looks like ( x 7 0 0 x x).  what i'm saying is, add the 5th (x 7 5 0 x x).  it's not much, but it sounds nice, makes the chord fuller, and also makes melodic sense, as A is scale degree 2, which leads down to scale degree 1 in the next chord, the G.<br><br>other than that, it's a pretty solid tab.  nice work.</p>", "difficulty": ""}, "title": "And So It Goes Tab", "provider": "ultimate-guitar", "chords": []},

I am not going to take the time to tab it out but the extra little chords are xx0353. xxxx87, xxx775. So play the first 3 notes of your D chord then the xx0353.
