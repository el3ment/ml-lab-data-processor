Drive out of the city, away from the crowds<br>
I thought heaven can't help me now.""<br>
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down<br>

He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
He's so bad but he does it so well<br>
I can see the end as it begins<br>
My one condition is<br>
<br>
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,<br>
Staring at the sunset, babe<br>
Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
Say you'll see me again<br>
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh, ah.<br>

I said, ""No one has to know what we do,""<br>
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room<br>
And his voice is a familiar sound,<br>
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now<br>

He's so tall and handsome as hell<br>
He's so bad but he does it so well<br>

She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper<br>
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya<br>
What would be a good time to reach ya<br>
<br>
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter<br>
'Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser<br>
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer<br>
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer<br>
<br>
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita<br>
Vroom speed up run faster than a cheetah<br>
Only thing on my mind is how I'm gone get all in this cheap slut<br>
Should I use a rubber 'cause I heard she was a freak<br>
But hey, say she keep it cleaned up but I don't want HIV bruh<br>
<br>
I drop my top on da drop-top, her name's on my beeper<br>
I called her on the Nokia and told her come pick me up<br>
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees<br>
And grabbed my penis, ate it up like some peanuts<br>
I said, â€½Ohh Kishaâ€<br>
<br>
Chopped off like a millimeter, she drunk it like a 2 liter<br>
She blow like a pro, oh no, I got to keep her<br>
Told her I'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her<br>
But don't go to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya<br>
<br>
Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight<br>
I'm gone give her a call, see if it's alright<br>
For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy<br>
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby<br>
<br>
Baby it's all good, I'll be there in a minute<br>
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it<br>
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin' out<br>
He saw me peepin' at him but he didn't open his mouth<br>
<br>
Soon as he pulled off, I knocked on the door<br>
Sayin' to myself look at this dog ass hoe<br>
It's cool what you do, you know I like my shit sucked<br>
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts<br>
<br>
Caught my nut, now I'm up, I'm gone holla at ya Kittie<br>
I got studio tonight, me and da H B'eezeys<br>

Say lil' mama where you headed, she told me forget it<br>
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it<br>
<br>
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first<br>
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst<br>
She was a fool with it<br>
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it<br>
'Cuz she knew what to do with it<br>
<br>
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin'<br>
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly<br>
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees<br>
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please<br>
<br>
I hit it she sucked it<br>
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it<br>
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it<br>
<br>
Hey hoe, I gotta ride<br>
My baby moma beepin' me<br>
And she stay way on the other side<br>
<br>
I hit B.G. on the celly<br>
And told him that<br>
The bitch was all good up in the alley,<br>
Not the telly<br>
<br>
This hoe don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs<br>
I caught her walkin' out the alley down by the mall<br>
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls<br>
But they told me she'd do a damn job on the balls<br>
<br>
She provided the number later on gave her a call<br>
Told her what I was thinkin' and she was down with it all<br>
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin' tall<br>
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law<br>
<br>
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss<br>
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall<br>
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk<br>
After two or three steps that hoe might fall<br>

Some Spanish girls love me like I’m Aventura<br>
Tell Uncle Luke I’m out in Miami too<br>
Clubbing hard, f-ckin women, there ain’t much to do<br>
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne<br>
Still getting brain from a thang, ain’t shit changed<br>
How you feel how you feel how you feel?<br>
25 sittin’ on 25 mil<br>
I’m in the building and I’m feeling myself<br>
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I’mma do it for the Bay<br>
Okay, getting paid, we’ll holler whenever that stop<br>
My team good, we don’t really need a mascot<br>
Tell Tune, “Light one, pass it like a relay”<br>

Me, Freddie and Marley Marl at the crib-o<br>
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo<br>

Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch<br>
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch<br>
That’s my MO, add a B to that shit<br>
I’m fucked up, torn down<br>
I’m twisted: door knob<br>
Talk stupid? Off with your head!<br>
Nigger money talks: I’m Mr. Ed<br>
I’m so Young Money got a drum on the gun<br>
Energizer bunny<br>
Funny how honey ain’t sweet like sugar<br>

<br>
spend  my time murdering verses,<br>
murdering lyricsts emergency nurses,<br>
so whatever the cases where ever the place is,<br>
i pick on the weak species so they call me a racist,<br>
but u dont know what is like to be ahead in huge paces,<br>
am an idol to society so i hear the praises,<br>
except from these faggets that say he is,<br>
a homophobic so calmn your gay hormones in places,<br>
even better turn straight by holding your dick with some braces,<br>
now that i covered bases lets get off the basics,<br>
i just put ur whole weeks of work and for me its just day six,<br>
so dont make me get physical cause i reload more than part two of the matrix,<br>
and big talk only comes when no one's down,<br>
but at the sound of the gun,<br>
you do like a track meet and start to run,<br>
so dont act hard cause i fight wit rhymes,<br>
shoot ur brains out and tell the cops u lost ur mind,<br>
am lyrical talent so i challenge u literal,<br>
its safe to say this is one of god's miracle,<br>
cause when fans hear my record they go to church praying for more,<br>
am not big time yet but i got one foot in the door,<br>
kicking it down chocking the game making em drown,<br>
am the knew crowned king so try to d-thrown me,<br>
u wish u had hits like this so u try to be me or at least clone me,<br>

<br>
verse 2,<br>
i take real actions so am hearing beef,<br>
one track is all i need cause my talkin is brief,<br>
say what u gotta say and hear comes death,<br>
best advice u'll ever hear is try saving your breath,<br>
u try to knock me off my spot but u only a challenger,<br>
check my sales, my poster move more untis than calenders,<br>
while u go through daily struggles am on an upward movement,<br>
so i gave a ring to tim allen and he gave me a home improvement,<br>
now, i understand jealously comes with the package,<br>
so i reach in my waste and am pulling out gadgets,<br>
finger on a trigger u now know u r fair game,<br>

u should have never test me i'll drop u back like mcnair's game,<br>
thats the reason for this talk about me being a rare gem,<br>
man, i dont take nothing for granted so dont slow down or delay,<br>
cause i still got dreams to accomplish like mtv made,<br>
but back when i didnt have money for no rent,<br>
the scence was no kodak moment,<br>
but now that everyting is here i put the guns and knifes down,<br>
cause i got easy access to the finer things in life now,<br>
so dont push devil outta me cause quickly i murder u literally,<br>
i wont make it painfull and thats just outta courtesy,<br>
but as heavy as the burden be,<br>
i carry it thankfully,<br>
cause if not all those digits in my bank account would just be make believe,<br>
but dont push your luck cause i might just snap,<br>
i wont even repeat myself this shits a rap,<br>
<br>
chorus, <br>

u shyne bright but i shyne brighter,<br>
so check your girl cause im alreay inside her,<br>

u shynne bright but i shyne brighter,<br>
so check your girl cause am already inside her,<br>

so give so more, give me some more, give me some more,<br>
<br>
verse 3,<br>
when i couldnt stand on my on feet and was about to fall,<br>
there was no hand reached out nowhere to lean involved,<br>
no freinds in sight no help at all,<br>
so i had to make something outta nothing like dante hall,<br>
never get a writers block so i dont hit no walls,<br>
u cant crawl urself outta this one especially if u aint go no claws at all,<br>
but in all the lines i drop dont leave u smiling,<br>
thats why i got more beef with rappers than bill o'riley,<br>
so dont take it lightly say please and pardon, <br>
before your face ends up in the back of milk cartons,<br>
now ya can kneel and start to praise me,<br>
and for ya that hate me, the shit dont face me,<br>
u try to make me disapear but u cant erase me,<br>
cause am just starting so u have to embrace me,<br>
the way i put words together u get a certain feel,<br>
am ahead of the game they way i play the field,<br>
cause i out there take heads of the way am deckin,<br>
i do what i do well and there is no regretin,<br>
cause girl love it even though am violent,<br>
i specialize in kickboxing and i aint from thailand,<br>
still i get specially attention so i ask for seconds,<br>
cause i get more love below than one of andres record,<br>

Go head and front and get your nose broke snuffa luffa kiss<br>
I'm the big bird, you's the big herb and thats just it<br>
Whatever you make in the hood I want in <br>
Not 10 but 50 percent, thats word to willy ding<br>
I flip whatever I cop, two times before n*ggas finish a pack<br>
Now that grind mode, fetti cash got a mean flow<br>
Plus I sting like a bee, who said I don't<br>
Bet I beat they face in like Ali<br>
Now say my name chump catch a few lumps<br>
Fetti cash is the champ you know I do this for my G's<br>
I do this for my thugs popping heat, im on grind getting no sleep<br>
Bringing them G's back<br>

Aiyo, the industy funny as hell<br>
All these wack MC's is sale, fronting like they capping off shells<br>
How he get a deal, listen to the lyrics he spit (listen)<br>
Everything I make, you play, if you hearing the hit<br>
I ain't signed, but I sell hooks and rhymes to rappers<br>
Go ahead, shine, I'mma get mines right after<br>
Probably heard me on the Thug Love soundtrack<br>
Or King Just album in '94, I was down with that<br>
Shaolin Soldiers, Black Fist era, thought it would pop<br>
Three hundred thousand copies sold, they called it a flop<br>
Then I signed to an independent, they tried to get me to do a Mase move<br>
Like Puff, sample a bass groove<br>
But, I do what I do, Two 4 War Entertainment<br>
Cover the globe like a wall when it's painted (uh-huh)<br>
We won't fall, check out the way I arranged this (uh-huh)<br>
You want war, look at the wolves that I came with<br>

<br>
[Fes Taylor]<br>
I put out an album with no distribution<br>
L.I.S. set out the trunk, that's the solution<br>
So we made it happen, laid and recorded<br>
Mixed it and mastered, pressed it and waxed it, made a classic<br>
I did the theme music for Kings of the Street<br>
End of the film, you hear it, it's the great L.G.<br>
I already got a fanbase, look all the fans wait<br>
Look all the damn hate, over money your man make<br>

Ended up being the number one song for 16 weeks<br>
Haters try to ruin me back, now you can't hold me<br>
I got known producers doing my tracks<br>
Killa Mac, you my secret weapon, got the people checking<br>
Volume One, Volume Two, soon as we release the record<br>
Plus the streets respect, you know I'm running with<br>
Shadow Government, bout to blow when you least expect it<br>

Battled for money, wolves they eat cattle, we hungry<br>
I performed at Freaknick and Jack the Rapper<br>
Ready to, jack a rapper, for ya platinum, yap ya<br>
Hit the Mid West, even did shows in Nebraska<br>
Crackers joked me on albums that he sold in Africa<br>
First Summer Jam, first ones to hit the stage<br>
If you realize it or not, that's history we made<br>
Some of ya'll rappers never got to spit on Kiss<br>
You only know about since Hot 97 exist<br>
We was on Rap City, before The Bassment<br>
Joe Clair; Big Tigger, son, he the replacement<br>
And DJ Enuff, yeah, he used to spin our records<br>
Wendy Williams played the promo with Specs, that's what respect is<br>

And some men would be kings<br>
And some men would be owners of land<br>
And other man made things<br>

And false love as the eternal flame<br>
Would move some to think in rings<br>
And gold would be our power<br>
And other foolish things<br>

But you who dream of liberty<br>
Must not yourselves be fooled<br>
Before you get to plea for freedom<br>
You have agreed to be ruled<br>
<br>
If the body stays a shackle<br>
Then the mind remains a chain<br>
That'll link you to a destiny<br>
Whereby all good souls are slain<br>

And it won't take long, it won't take too long at all<br>
It won't take long and you may say<br>

They say time is in the river<br>

Dry in spirit dry in body<br>
Two will lend themselves to death<br>
And in grief one weeps into his hands<br>
And drinks his bitter tears<br>

It don't take long and you may say<br>

And I say, ""You mean to tell me that's all?""<br>

And as I stand before you now<br>
I am hopeful in my rage<br>
You know love has finally called for me<br>
I will not wilt upon its stage<br>
<br>
But still smaller than my nightmare<br>
Do I print upon the page?<br>
Do we have to live inside its walls<br>
To identify the cage?<br>
<br>
'Cause it takes so long, why does it take so long?<br>
But it takes so long and you may say<br>
""I don't really care what you're talking about""<br>
And I say, ""Are you trying to say you don't belong?""<br>

There is something we must do<br>

It won't take long and you may say<br>

Human strength will fill the streets<br>
Of every city on our planet<br>
Hear the sound of angry feet<br>

With business freeze up in the harbor<br>
The kings will pull upon their hair<br>
And the banks will shudder to a halt<br>
And the artists will be there<br>

Will disappear that honored day<br>

Lifted candles light the way<br>

As underneath the sun and moon<br>
A ritual'd wailing has begun<br>

It won't take long and you may say<br>
""I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about""<br>
And it makes me want to say, ""Come on""<br>
<br>
And beware you sagging diplomats<br>
For you will not hear one gun<br>
And though our homes be torn<br>
And ransacked we will not be undone<br>
<br>
For as we let ourselves be bought<br>
We're gonna let ourselves be free<br>
And if you think we stand alone<br>
Look again and you will see<br>
<br>
We are children in the rafters<br>
We are babies in the park<br>
We are lovers at the movies<br>
We are candles in the dark<br>
<br>
We are changes in the weather<br>
We are snowflakes in July<br>
We are women grown together<br>
We are men who easily cry<br>
<br>
We are words not quickly spoken<br>
We're the deeper side of try<br>
We are dreamers in the making<br>
We are not afraid of why?<br></p>",It Won't Take Long,http://www.songlyrics.com/ferron/it-won-t-take-long-lyrics/,Ferron,songlyrics,

Then I might have missed the chance<br>

I'm in between the moon and tomorrows light<br>
And I cannot know how close you are.<br>

And I ask you, are we friends too<br>

I talk to my sister about it all<br>
To see what she did when she was here<br>
She tells me don't give up your freedom<br>
Which goes to show freedom is not so clear<br>
I'm alive in my center<br>
And true to the core is (in) how I feel<br>
(And) I don't believe I have entered<br>

Your basic demons tell you fools come late<br>

Where the quiet meets the cracking of a heartbreak<br>

And some mountains you're not supposed to know.<br>
<br>
It's like...some people got their wild wild hearts<br>
And some others bide their time until they meet them<br>
When co ordinates are disappearing stars<br>
Maps can't help you can't believe them<br>
You need good vision, clear water in your flask<br>
And time to feel the surging of your heart beat<br>

Your best companion is the one who's gonna ask about<br>
Your soul-lined connection to your foolish feet.<br>

Takes A Little Time<br>
Sadie's momma was a tanker always bowling her<br>
down to the ground<br>
And when Sadie got old enough she moved it on<br>
Her freedom was a one way bus to another town<br>
She had a little money, bought a dress and she put it on<br>
And she worked her days in an all night restaurant<br>
It was called believe or not...Anything You Want<br>
<br>
There was a woman on the graveyard shift that<br>
Sadie liked a lot<br>
And she even took to coming early just in case<br>
they could have some time<br>
It seemed that anything the graveyard lady wanted<br>
the graveyard lady got<br>
And Sadie decided the difference between them<br>
was a shadow line<br>

to be her own true face<br>

She sends a letter home to say ""I've come undone""<br>
All they say ""that's tough""<br>

one night that she can fly<br>
And she goes to work that day and all she does is cry cry cry<br>
<br>
And Sadie finally meet a man who dances a jig<br>
and she follows him down<br>
But don't he turn out to be a little angel of misery<br>
Living quiet in a private dream, protected by a frozen frown<br>
Periodically he looks up and says<br>
""Sadie, what's to become of you and me?""<br>
It's at these times that she holds his head<br>
Half wishing all the while that he's holding her instead<br>
And she finally tells him that and it blows his mind...<br>

the kind with just a lonely mind and heart <br>
And from where you stand you're an attractive revelation <br>
And from where I stand I'm mostly on my knees <br>
And from there I said hello, felt something small and slow <br>
Say ""Please, please, please"" <br>

I remember waiting for my story to begin.<br>
Had all my laughs cut short, a boat without a port<br>
A ragged house of tin.<br>
But ... maybe it's true about the teacher when you're ready<br>
Maybe it's true about the hollow and the slope<br>
Love, turn my steps around<br>
Let me fall on solid ground with Faith and rope.<br>

And outside that window there's a window shining in<br>
And it shows a room that has a fire steady burning<br>
And a woman knowing that the darkness can't come in<br>
And she wants to thank you for your love and understanding<br>
She needs to thank you for your honour to the soul<br>
It's love from someone who believed she'd need a stand in<br>
To tell her story let alone to live it whole<br>
<br>
And though it's just a thought, she says it's all we've got<br>
For every person there's a rhyme and a reason<br>
To decide to be the chosen one to stand among<br>
the broken ones.<br>
<br>
stand among the broken ones,<br>
stand among the broken ones...<br>
<br>
For every person<br>
May love come through<br>
For every person<br>
May love come through<br></p>",The Chosen Ones,http://www.songlyrics.com/ferron/the-chosen-ones-lyrics/,Ferron,songlyrics,

These Foolish Things (Marvell/Strachey/Link) (Brian Ferry, 1973)<br>
<br>
oh will you never let me be<br>
oh will you never set me free<br>
the ties that bound us<br>
are still around us<br>
there=B9s no escape that I can see<br>
and still those little things remain<br>
that bring me happiness or pain<br>
<br>
a cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces<br>
an airline ticket to romantic places<br>
and still my heart has wings<br>
these foolish things<br>
remind me of you<br>

a tinkling piano in the next apartment<br>
those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant<br>
a fairgrounds painted swings<br>
these foolish things<br>
remind me of you<br>
<br>
you came<br>
you saw<br>
you conquered me<br>
when you did that to me I somehow knew that this had to be<br>
<br>
the winds of March that make my heart a dancer<br>
a telephone that rings but who=B9s to answer<br>
oh how the ghost of you clings<br>

how sweet<br>

Slave To Love<br>
lyrics to ""Slave to Love"" by Bryan Ferry<br>
<br>
Tell her I'll be waiting<br>
in the usual place<br>
with the tired and weary<br>
and there's no escape.<br>
<br>
To need a women<br>
you've got to know<br>
how the strong get weak<br>
and the rich get poor.<br>
<br>
Slave to love<br>
Oh Oh<br>
Slave to love<br>
<br>
You're running with me <br>
don't touch the ground<br>
we're the restless hearted<br>
not the chained and bound.<br>
<br>
The sky is burning<br>
a sea of flame<br>
though your world is changing<br>
I will be the same.<br>

Can you help me?<br>
Oh oh<br>
Can you help me?<br>

The storm is breaking<br>
or so it seems<br>
we're too young to reason <br>
too grown to dream.<br>
<br>
Now spring is turning <br>
your face to mine<br>
I can hear your laughter<br>
I can see your smile.<br>

Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American dream.<br>
About me, about you, about the way our American hearts beat way down<br>
in the bottom of our chests.  About the special feeling we get in the<br>
cockles of our hearts, maybe below the cockles, maybe in the subcockle<br>
area.  Maybe in the liver.  Maybe in the kidneys.  Maybe even in the<br>
colon, we don't know.<br>

I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.<br>
I'm your average white suburbanite slob.<br>
I like football and porno and books about war.<br>
I've got an average house with a nice hardwood floor.<br>
<br>
My wife and my job, my kids and my car.<br>
My feet on my table and a cuban cigar.<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
And from the end is where this poem starts<br>
No regards, watering the rose and still we grow apart<br>
Hopeless hearts, anxious dip your toes with sharks<br>
I’m floating in the ocean on top of shards of Noah's Ark<br>
Ride the wave cautious, and then I set sail<br>
Arrived on dry land, walking, on an egg shell<br>
With lead bells, blowing the whistle man I just left hell<br>
Nothing to regret well except maybe that death smell<br>
Behind the red veil enjoying the best seats<br>
The rest grieve, nothing to show for it but prestige<br>
Wonder what success brings, I go against the jet stream<br>

Craft a legend of a time before the apathetic<br>
Let’s start a tab, what will you have is that cash or credit<br>
How about a glass of purgatory with a splash of heaven<br>
Watch your language if you ain't off in the speakeasy<br>
To speak freely on mechanisms in streets see we<br>
Draw the weapon freehand call em artiste really<br>
Paint the block into a motif of grief bleeding<br>
Speed reading making educated guesses<br>
Don’t talk without thinking life's teaching you a lesson<br>
Might learn something if you listen for a second<br>
Then consider it a blessing if you’re living to regret it<br>
I ain't scheming on Dolce, thinking about groceries<br>
Heard it loud and tier in that surround sound Dolby<br>
Subzero planet really almost froze me<br>

Rumors the gossip I ignore that<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Before Clinton impeachment, when the Legion was packed<br>
On the weekend throwing creases in your best pair of slacks<br>
Sportin' Waves, pomade, doo-rags to keep em flat<br>
Though you still could catch a fade by how you leaning you hat<br>
Peek at photographs dull pieces of glass<br>
Mahogany frames take a brief leap in the past<br>
And looks can be deceiving what you meet at a glance<br>
Since we all got secrets that we keep 'til we ash<br>
Sleeping giant alone with my thoughts in private<br>
Got a thirst for knowledge not a drop in the Tigris<br>
On the walk to Zion enduring the hottest climate<br>
Describing these times as rough, they claim that I’m not a diamond<br>
Lost on the path, watching for thieves and pirates<br>
Lapsed, back sliding, and can’t stop me from being righteous<br>
In the middle of the crisis don’t knock until you try it<br>
Just follow that trail of tears, moment of silence<br></p>",Monochrome,http://www.songlyrics.com/lorange-stik-figa/monochrome-lyrics/,L’Orange & Stik Figa ,songlyrics,

Verse 1 (Stik Figa) <br>
<br>
And the hardest part of life became the easiest <br>
The older that I get, reconciling all the sequences <br>
Archive the memories, recall, retrieving it <br>
Recipe for disaster substitute ingredients <br>
It’s hot in the kitchen can’t sweat no conveniences <br>
Let it all fall in the batter loves tedious <br>
Labor of it all please have a piece of it <br>
Confection and critique of it <br>
And see how bittersweet it is <br>
Committed this egregious sin, which I plead the fifth <br>
In the court of your opinion do I need defense? <br>
Being judged by my peers do I need repent <br>
Drowning in my own conscious though, its sink or swim <br>
And the devil’s hella busy trying to cripple my faith <br>
Placing seeds of doubt in a difficult space <br>
But what’s new? These here are critical days <br>

Second Verse - Has-Lo <br>
Giving on the fountain that retains my youth, <br>
my illusion is a jewel, I entertain the muse. <br>
Sitting on the pedestal, nothing ever moves <br>
?never do a dap, it's the apathy do? <br>
Know that I embrace what I can't control, <br>
'til I'm out of my death, til I finally rest. <br>
Til the angel in the road lift me out of my flesh <br>
and my soul turns to energy, a sinner's relief. <br>
All the buzz words and fluff terms apart <br>
To ever be a star, you must learn to chart. <br>
The smart take heed, the wise. <br>
When you're always right you begin to miss being surprised. <br>
Every day my eyes open up, shades are drawn. <br>
I awake ?any side that I face are wrong? <br>
But still, I pull up, chin up the bar. <br>

You say, you love me so bad but you won't let me be myself<br>

You say, you love me so bad, why can't we play the hand we're dealt<br>

You say lately I've been acting strangely and irrationally<br>
And after all the things I've said, you're confused and rightfully<br>
I said, I wanna take you there, when she tries I just retreat<br>
And says that I won't open up and when I do, she's pulling teeth<br>
<br>
I admit that I have some baggage, I ain't ready to release<br>
Commitment in relationships comes with difficulty<br>
She says, ""I sabotage myself"", I said, ""I don't disagree""<br>
She says, ""Until you leave the past behind we'll never be happy""<br>

Love me, love me, love me<br>

It's these elitist multimedia creeps that feed shit to the neediest<br>
It's the greediest tryin' to cheat us out of our God-given rights<br>
To a quality education, minimal opportunities available<br>
Limited occupations, we are not given a choice<br>
<br>
Or given a voice within a political system pimped and gangstered-out<br>
Wherein the people are the victims, sheep, bein' led about<br>
While the followers and patrons of any faith outside the mainstream<br>
Are berated, falsely painted as endangerin' the way things were<br>
<br>
And the way things are tonight<br>
I can't believe that things ain't worse<br>
With all the wicked seeds we've sown have grown<br>
And poisoned all the earth<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">Now how many songs do you figure that I've written<br>
Since I originally started making records in this business<br>
Back beginning in college and it's been a menace since then<br>
But the principal challenge, it ain't really that different<br>
<br>
It's about me not repeating myself at all<br>
Or at least repeating myself the least amount possible<br>
The reason being is that we need some songs<br>
That lead us off the beaten path between my rhymes<br>
<br>
But now listen though, it's difficult now a-days<br>
To really go against the grain, get you some accolades<br>
Especially with these frigid, finicky, fickle-ass motherfuckers<br>
Think they finally figured you out, the fake-ass fuck<br>
<br>
Stop complaining, stop<br>
I know, it's just that certain shit pisses me off<br>
What am I gonna do? I mean<br>
<br>
Man, fuck that shit, I pay my taxes when I'm asked to<br>
I'm not enthusiastic about it but shit, I make it happen<br>
Yeah, it's last minute, but goddammit they cash it<br>
This is fiscal harassment, they keep touching my assets<br>
<br>
Now I imagine I might be feeling different about it<br>
If it was given outright, witness it helping somebody<br>
But it just so happens in life, the school district's too crowded<br>
There ain't no teachers in sight, that's why the kids are so rowdy<br>
<br>
I just imagine some asshole with glasses on, up at the capital<br>
One of a thousand pawns packed in an office<br>
Cramped up like animals<br>
Pictures of his sister, his mixture Lhasa Apso poodle<br>
His 2.6 kids, the missus thumb-tacked to his cubicle<br>
<br>
So damned detached from the average man's planet<br>
He can't fathom<br>
That he can ever be anything other than stats, fat and taxable<br>
He's getting his usual, ritual 2 o'clock cup of noodles on<br>
Fucking you with your W-2 with his John Denver music on<br>
<br>

(But look what they sayin' about me)<br>
<br>
Is he a role model we can all follow full throttle<br>
So we don't bother having to create our own model<br>
That we go by a fall guy I can hold accountable<br>
'Cause I don't want to hold the bottle for my own child<br>
<br>
Is it really my place to raise little Billy<br>
When Hilly and William should be building<br>
With him in the living room<br>
Instead of bailing on him and alienating him<br>
Basically failing him<br>
Sending him sailing on a mission to oblivion<br>
<br>
Then, inevitably on his day in court and Billy ain't to blame<br>
The bailiff asks him to raise his arm and say his name in court<br>
Of course his parents ain't in court, they play it off<br>
Saying it ain't his fault<br>
Blame it on Asian Born or his favorite artist<br>
Beg your pardon?<br>
<br>
Now, I do admit that in the music business<br>
People do and say some really stupid shit<br>
Kids are zooming in and using what we do and say<br>
I can see how you can say, do not abuse your influence<br>
<br>
But to all the Hillaries and the Williams of the new millennium<br>
If you really aren't feeling like living with the children<br>
Will be a fulfilling experience<br>
Or something you envision yourself willingly<br>
And unconditionally committed to from the beginning<br>
<br>
Maybe you shouldn't be bumping uglies<br>
From the giddy up anyway, dummies<br>

That I had gaffled from a scrap metal yard<br>
<br>
When it fell apart, I got a rental car<br>
With mental Art Lemmon's credit card<br>
Double-parked on the boulevard in front of Cinnabon<br>
Won a tug-of-war with a minotaur<br>
Then I toured the far north on a Portuguese Man-o-War<br>
<br>
Santa Claus handed me a catalog<br>
The envelope attached on it said<br>
That you can have it all<br>
So I got an antelope from Manitoba<br>
Salad bowl, a catapult, a can of soda<br>
Paddleboat, a camera phone<br>
<br>
And also a Barry Manilow autographed cantaloupe<br>
And every episode of 'Solid Gold'<br>
The antidote to Babylon and Amazon<br>
In an acid-washed can of salt<br>

At 40 below, lo and behold<br>
My homey poked too many holes in my snowmobile wheels<br>
Now I'm rollin' on some Boboli's with spokes<br>
<br>
Had to pony up the dough to get it all green and gold<br>
Mumble ho, stole an Oreo, a Polaroid, some saltines<br>
An overcoat from Walgreens<br>
Some corduroys, some sardines, canola oil<br>
All singin', 'Row, Row, Row Ya Boat'<br>
<br>
On and on, with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Shinobi and Kobe Bryant<br>
Pokemon and Pinocchio on the Okefenokee Swamp<br>

Curb swervin' in a purple Suburban, slurpin' an urange sherbert<br>
Eatin' a turnip with the words 'Dirty Dirty'<br>

Every night I toss and turn in my sleep<br>
And it hurts when I breathe, I'm gettin' a little worried 'bout it<br>
Combination on the stress and the strain, I ain't slept now for days<br>
And I just can't get my head around it<br>
<br>
All the drama in the world that we live<br>
We learn how to give, I can't sit back and do nothin' 'bout it<br>
Wanna know whatever happened to love, compassion and drugs<br>
'Cause it seem like we forgot about it<br>

Stop complaining<br>
<br>
Now how many songs do you figure that I've written?<br>
Since I originally started, makin' records in this business<br>
Back beginnin' in college and it's been a menace since then<br>
But the principal challenge, it ain't really that different<br>
<br>
It's about me not repeatin' myself at all<br>
Or at least repeatin' myself the least amount, I suppose<br>
The reason bein' is that we need some songs<br>
That lead us off the beaten path between my rhymes<br>
<br>
But now listen though, it's difficult now a-days<br>
To really go against the grain, get you some accolades<br>
Especially with these frigid, finicky, fickle-ass motherfuckers<br>
Think they finally figured you out, the fake-ass fuckers<br>
<br>
Stop complaining<br>
(I know, it's just that certain shit pisses me off)<br>
Stop complaining<br>
(What am I gonna do? I mean)<br>
<br>
Man, fuck that shit, I pay my taxes when I'm asked to<br>
I'm not enthusiastic about it but shit I make it happen<br>
Yeah, it's last minute but goddammit they cash it<br>
(This is fiscal harassment, they keep touchin' my assets)<br>
<br>
Now I imagine, I might be feelin' different about it<br>
If it was given outright, witnessin' it helpin' somebody<br>
But it just so happens in life, the school district's too crowded<br>
There ain't no teachers in sight, that's why the kids are so rowdy<br>
<br>
I just imagine some asshole with glasses on up at the capital<br>
One of a thousand pawns packed in an office, cramped up like animals<br>
Pictures of his sister, his mixture Lhasa Apso poodle<br>
His 2.6 kids and the missus thumb-tacked to his cubicle<br>
<br>
So damned detached from the average man's planet, he can't fathom<br>
That he can ever be anythin' other than stats, fat and taxable<br>
He's gettin' his usual, ritual 2 o'clock cup of noodles on<br>
Fuckin' you with your W-2, with his John Denver music on<br>
<br>
Hey, um ooh, I love this one<br>
Hey 'lil? Can you get me the file on?<br>
Blah blah blah blah blah?<br>
Yeah, he's makin' too much money<br>

Stop complaining<br>

<br>
Is he a role model we can all follow full throttle<br>
So we don't bother having to create our own model<br>
That we go by, a fall guy I can hold accountable?<br>
'Cuz I don't want to hold the bottle for my own child<br>
<br>
Is it really my place to raise little Billy?<br>
When Hilly and William should be buildin' with him in the living room<br>
Instead of bailin' on him and alienatin' him and basically failin' him<br>
Sendin' him sailin' on a mission to oblivion?<br>
<br>
Then, inevitably on his day in court and Billy ain't to blame<br>
The bailiff asks him to raise his arm and say his name in court<br>
Of course his parents ain't in court, they play it off<br>
Sayin' it ain't his fault, blame it on Asian Born or his favorite artist<br>
Beg your pardon?<br>
<br>
Now, I do admit that in the music business<br>
People do and say some really stupid shit<br>
Now the kids are zoomin' in and usin' what we do and say<br>
I can see how you can say, ""Do not abuse your influence""<br>
<br>
But to all the Hillaries and the Williams of the new millennium<br>
If you really aren't feelin' like livin' with the children will be a fulfillin'<br>
Experience or somethin' you envision yourself willingly<br>
And unconditionally committed to from the beginnin'<br>
<br>
Maybe you shouldn't be bumpin' bellies<br>
From the giddy up anyway, dummy<br>

There is one<br>
You got something to say<br>
And it goes a little something like this<br>
<br>
From the gate, what you know about rapping motherfucker<br>
You can't even hold the microphone without it feedbacking<br>
Since the days of speed rapping I've been snapping cats spinal bones<br>
Embarrass them in front of women take their little titles home<br>
Bear in mind I come from an era in time<br>
Where you actually had to have lyrics that rhyme<br>
Let my baritone grind your insides, paralyze your cerebellum<br>
Throw with your reality out of a nine mit?<br>
<br>
Flip shit, on some pimp shit, on some rock shit<br>
Some rap rock testosterone rip shit<br>
Look inside every magazine you read about me<br>
Got an excerpt, your sissy ass crew's afraid to say the fucking f-word<br>
Tired of playing games, I don't know the password<br>
How's about this, open up the damn cash drawer<br>
Throw the keys on the dashboard<br>
Let the real players play this shit<br>
Yah can fucking wretch up?<br>
<br>
Pack up get started walking<br>
Fall back now on your losses<br>
You can't accomplish<br>
But you won't defeat no contest, baby<br>
<br>
Forfeit, don't rock the call pit<br>
Chalk this up as a conquest<br>
Some things is sacred<br>
I don't play with my stage or my audience<br>
<br>
Smooth talking charismatic ass ill<br>
Talk you lady outta bra<br>
Honda hatchback hand held y'all starved<br>
And I'm dangling a shrimp by the fan tail<br>
Whole audience about to fall over the handrail<br>
I can't tell is that rapping?<br>
Dude sound like a fucking parrot just crash landed<br>
Man this shit is ass backwards these days real crazy<br>
I can count on one hand cats that's truly creative<br>
<br>
And the rest is all get along go along guys<br>
Happy not to get involved just along for the ride<br>
No vision, no drive, spirit or wherewithal<br>
You can get mad and stay mad at that I don't care at all<br>

With small daily victories this shits a game of inches<br>
I sustained minor injuries scuffles with the missus<br>
For the chance to make history, I don't regret it for a minute<br>
Seeing cats drop a small fortune on plush ride blau?<br>
Couple years later fools is upside down<br>
Tell me what the fuck did you get in this game for<br>
It's like a whole world of squirrels only one acorn<br>
<br>
I don't usually like to take it back<br>
But realistically if this was a different era<br>
Y'all would fail miserably<br>
Ghetto team I'm going in, take me down fifty feet<br>
I never let this industry put me in the guillotine<br>
Rapelle down the skyscraper kicking in the plexiglass<br>
Plastique on the safe boom blown to Leningrad<br>
Stuff the cash and the formula in the fifty bag<br>
Slide down the rope, twenty stories hail a taxi cab<br>

I can't be worried 'bout, all the fellas, little sad commas<br>
They all think that they experts, and yet they got drama<br>
I love 'em, they my partners but tommorow's not promised<br>
<br>
And life is too short to really not do it big<br>
And I can't live it, thinkin' what I could or should've did<br>
'Cause at some point, you really gotta take that leap of faith<br>
And do exactly what your homeboy said wasn't safe<br>
<br>
'Cause I really do believe that God awards risk<br>
Especially with love man, 'cause that's the hardest shit<br>
To give yourself a hundred percent in this partnership<br>
For a lot of people, that's just a little hard to give<br>
<br>
But if it feels right, it clicks and everything's legit<br>
We could have it for a minute, ain't nobody really trip<br>
And in your heart you say, it can't get deeper than this<br>
Then there really ain't no reason why it shouldn't be it<br>

They say that man choose with their eyes, women choose with their ears<br>
Whatever choice it was we made, brought us here<br>
Some decisions we make out of faith, some out of fear<br>
Sometimes it's so confusin', we don't know which way to steer<br>
<br>
Some of us have been through so much in life already<br>
That we totally lost, the desire to feel anything<br>
Ice cold below, the fire below senegrate<br>
Behind ninety foot walls, that can't nobody penetrate<br>
<br>
A lot of cats out there was damaged<br>
They feel they gotta act a certain way, otherwise there ain't manership<br>
A lotta women got issues with trust<br>
'Cause the man that they love had bounced on 'em more than once<br>
<br>
But you know we all been there, it's not that bomb at all<br>
Just chop it as a loss, get back up and walk it off<br>
Can't wave the white flag, can't throw in the towel<br>

Gibst du erst auf wenn du nicht mehr stehst?<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">This is hard for me to write, it's difficult to express this<br>
It's heavy on my shoulders and the weight gets relentless<br>
The story of brothers and a beautiful friendship<br>
And how relations get strained with pressure and tension<br>
<br>
Who's wrong, correct, so, so, subjective?<br>
You look back, it's hard 'cos the mind gets adventurous<br>
Dates get mixed up, facts disconnected<br>
The only thing you remember is the feeling that you're left with<br>
It started as a blessing<br>
<br>
Now you could write this off as luck or one of life's coincidences<br>
But at some point you think, goddamn what are the chances<br>
Of people with similar interests and influences<br>
Coming together at that moment to form a kinship<br>
<br>
It's like you knew that you was brothers before your conception<br>
Even if you're not a spiritual person, I admit shit<br>
At that point, I wasn't but at some point it sets in<br>
It'd be foolish to dismiss this as coincidence<br>
<br>
Now this shit is different, somewhere this is written<br>
Be part of a mission, this shit is predestined<br>
Closer than close like flesh is to tendon<br>
Share my 50 cent bag of chips with my freshman<br>
<br>
Half a half a gas station, sandwich, no question<br>
Talking shit to me, well, then talking shit to him then<br>
Family is sacred, it must be protected<br>
Family is sacred and it must be protected<br>
<br>
Over time I don't know what happens, something got infected<br>
People grow in different ways at different rates, I guess<br>
It ridiculous, little shit, it suddenly gets big shit<br>
Lapses in communication, glitches in the system<br>
<br>
He said that she said what? Nobody said shit<br>
But you'll never know 'cos everyone's passive aggressive<br>
I sit down smoke pow wow, how everyone said shit<br>
People cease to make the effort to get to the essence<br>
<br>

Funny thing is that you and I do it every minute<br>
We take it in rhetoric every time somebody says shit<br>
Against us, stock piling every little incident<br>
<br>
What's stupid is all the bullshit that's circulating<br>
Could be fixed in an instant with simple conversation<br>
But you know how pride is, a bitch with her fist clenched<br>
That mixed with the fat drama, gets addictive<br>
<br>
Wounds need dressing and they don't receive attention<br>
Snowballs and festers and creates resentment<br>
People demonise each other, brave discontentment<br>
But nobody could've been prepared for the next step<br>
<br>
The nature of the predator is calculated, pensive<br>
Waiting in the brush, patiently revving they engines<br>
Despite the color that they got, all they see is crimson<br>
Waiting for they prey to become desperate defenseless<br>
<br>
Outside is always over just beyond the fences<br>
Today the gate is open, though today they make an entrance<br>
Friendly at first, laughs, jokes, like we best friends<br>
Slowly though, you start to see they become hidden agendas<br>
<br>
Nine to five, one day, insecure, self perceptions<br>
Shines a spotlight on all those paranoid crevices<br>
Things begin to heat up, everyone's already stretched thin<br>
How could you be, well, how could you be so deceptive?<br>
<br>
Any second now, someone will snap like a bread stick<br>
And what once was simply dissolves like a breath mint<br>
Just like that you start to ask yourself questions<br>
â€½Is this really worth all the emotion and depressment?â€<br>
<br>
â€½Do the benefits and perks outweigh the pressure?â€<br>

One morning in July<br>
Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen<br>
And she smiled as she passed me by.<br>
She looked so sweet from her two white feet<br>
To the sheen of her nut-brown hair<br>
Such a coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself<br>
To make sure I was standing there.<br>
<br>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay<br>
And from Galway to Dublin town<br>
No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen<br>
That I met in the County Down.<br>
<br>
As she onward sped I shook my head<br>
And I gazed with a feeling rare<br>
And I said, says I, to a passerby<br>
""Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?""<br>

That I met in the County Down.<br>
<br>
I've travelled a bit, but never was hit<br>
Since my roving career began<br>
But fair and square I surrendered there<br>
To the charms of young Rose McCann.<br>

Did I meet with in shawl or gown<br>

And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes<br>
And I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering lies<br>
On the heart of the nut-brown rose.<br>
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke<br>
Though with rust my plow turns brown<br>

Leaving home and well-known ground<br>
For a new world to be found<br>
'Cause it has been his dearest wish<br>
<br>
Since he was young<br>
To travel around the world, to be fancy-free<br>
But every time he set a date<br>
There was a little something to care about<br>
<br>
So he never left, don't look at me that way<br>

But you are not a bird<br>
And life is catching up as you know<br>
<br>
Not too young and so in love and perfectly close<br>
But yet no answer in her heart<br>
When he came to propose<br>
So she said she needed time<br>
<br>
But as she hesitated, he knew so well<br>
Time was not his friend<br>
Time went by without a word<br>
And he was not the man to ask again<br>

And he is, as they say, wild and crazy<br>
As a composer, arranger and producer, he's exploring it all<br>

From the furthest reaches of musical outer space<br>
To the most down to earth funk<br>
And he sounds<br>
Well, he sounds exactly like this<br>

Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?<br>

'Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollipop<br>

Morning, sir<br>
Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium<br>
Ah, thank you, my good man<br>
What can I do for you, sir?<br>
<br>
Well, I was sitting in the public library<br>
On Thurmon Street just now<br>
Skimming through Rogue Herrys by Hugh Walpole<br>
And I suddenly came over all peckish<br>
<br>
Peckish, sir?<br>
Esuriant<br>
Eh<br>
'Ee, ah wor 'ungry-loike<br>
Ah, hungry<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, and I thought<br>
To myself, A little fermented curd will do the trick<br>
So I curtailed my Walpoling activites<br>
Sallied forth and infiltrated your place<br>
Of purveyance to negotiate the vending<br>
Of some cheesy comestibles<br>
<br>
Come again<br>
I want to buy some cheese<br>
Oh, I thought you were complaining<br>
About the bazouki player<br>
Oh, heaven forbid, I am one who delights<br>
In all manifestations of the Terpsichorean muse<br>
<br>
Sorry?<br>
'Ooo, ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too<br>
So he can go on playing, can he<br>
Most certainly, now then<br>
Some cheese please, my good man<br>
<br>
Certainly, sir,  what would you like?<br>
Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester?<br>
I'm afraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, sir<br>
Oh, never mind, how are you on Tilsit?<br>
<br>
I'm afraid we never have that at the end of the week<br>
Sir, we get it fresh on Monday<br>
Tish tish,  no matter, well stout yeoman<br>
Four ounces of Caerphilly, if you please<br>

I'll have a look, sir, umh, no<br>
It's not much of a cheese shop, is it?<br>
<br>
Finest in the district<br>
Explain the logic underlying that conclusion, please<br>
Well, it's so clean, sir<br>
It's certainly uncontaminated by cheese<br>

Have you, shut that bloody bazouki up<br>
Told you sir<br>
<br>
Have you got any Limburger?<br>
No<br>
Figures, predictable, really I suppose<br>
It was an act of purest optimism<br>
To have posed the question in the first place<br>
<br>
Tell me?<br>
Yes, sir<br>
Have you, in fact, got any cheese here at all?<br>
Yes, sir<br>
Really?<br>
No, not really, sir<br>
<br>
You haven't?<br>
No, sir, not a scrap<br>

Wasting your time, sir<br>

Beautiful Girl<br>
Looking at the room, I can tell that you.<br>
Are the most beautiful girl in the...room.<br>
(In the whole wide room).<br>
And when you're on the street, depending on the street.<br>
I bet you are definitely in the top 3.<br>

And when I saw you at my man's place.<br>
I thought...what, is she, doing...at my man's place.<br>
How did he get a hottie like that to a party like this?<br>
Good one, Dave.<br>
(Ooh, you're a LEGEND, Dave).<br>
<br>
I asked Dave if he's going to move on you.<br>
He's not sure.<br>
""Dave, do you mind if I do?""<br>
He says he doesn't mind.<br>

Like a tree. Or a high class prostitute.<br>

So, youâ€™re leaving, arenâ€™t you?<br>
I knew it when you said just then when you told me you were leaving<br>

But if youâ€™re trying to break my heart<br>
Your plan is flawed from the start<br>
You canâ€™t break my heart, itâ€™s liquid<br>

No, Iâ€™m not crying<br>

The only time I had sex was on the phone<br>

But that was long ago<br>
I carved our names upon that tree<br>
I loved him and he loved me<br>
My darling wife was once a he<br>

But that was long ago<br>
He'd always whisper in my ear<br>
But then I started drinkin' beer<br>

""The Lunchlady""<br>
[Laughing]<br>
<br>
Woke up in the morning<br>
Put on my new plastic glove<br>
Served some reheated salisbury steak<br>
With a little slice of love<br>
Got no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of<br>
Just know everything's doing fine<br>
Down here in Lunchlady Land<br>
Well I wear this net on my head<br>
'Cause my red hair is fallin' out<br>
I wear these brown orthopedic shoes<br>
'Cause I got a bad case of the gout<br>
I know you want seconds on the corndogs<br>
But there's no reason to shout<br>
Everybody gets enough food<br>
Down here in Lunchlady Land<br>
Well yesterday's meatloaf is today's sloppy joes<br>
And my breath reeks of tuna<br>
And there's lots of black hairs coming out of my nose<br>
In Lunchlady Land your dreams come true<br>
Clouds made of carrots and peas<br>
Mountains built of shepherds pie<br>
And rivers made of macaroni and cheese<br>
But don't forget to return your trays<br>
And try to ignore my gum disease<br>
No student can escape the magic of Lunchlady Land<br>

It screamed, why do you burn me<br>
And serve me up cold<br>
I said I got the spatula<br>
Just do what you're told<br>
Then the liver &amp; onions<br>
Started joining the fight<br>
And the chocolate pudding<br>
Pushed me with all its might<br>
And the chop suey slapped me<br>
And it kicked me in the head<br>
It's called revenge Lunchlady<br>
Said the garlic bread<br>
I said what did I do<br>
To make you all so mad<br>
They said you got flabby arms<br>
And your breath is bad<br>
Then the green beans said<br>
You better run and hide<br>
But then my friend sloppy joe came<br>
And joined my side<br>
He said if it wasn't for the Lunchlady<br>
The kids wouldn't eatcha<br>
You should be shakin' her hand<br>
And sayin' please to meet ya<br>
She gives you a purpose<br>
And she gives you a goal<br>
You should be kissin' her feet<br>
And kissin' her mole<br>
Now all the angry foods<br>
Just leave me alone<br>
And we all live together<br>
In a happy home<br>
Thanks to<br>
sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe<br>
sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe<br>
sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe<br>
sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe<br>

We had ourselves no secrets, we had no fears<br>
There was nothing we wouldn't do when we were in the sack<br>
She'd even pop the zit on my back<br>

She caught me red-handed and said, ""We're through""<br>
Now she got a new boyfriend, it nearly gave me a heart attack<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">I'm happily married with a house and three mistresses<br>
Even with the beard I'm not as hairy as my sister is<br>
Got a new Hummer, two Ferraris, and some Lexuses<br>
And all the girls I know got the big big breasteses<br>
I got a ten story mansion on the beach<br>
With a swimmin' pool filled up with the drool of Robin Leach<br>
Richer than a Twinkie, I got so much cash<br>
That to me Paris Hilton is poor white trash<br>
I take forty-seven weeks of vacation a year<br>
If people piss me off I can make 'em disappear<br>
Every time I sneeze I get a feature on the news<br>
The reporter says ""gesundheit"" and hilarity ensues<br>
And how did I get to be the man that I am?<br>
A god among men, only without the tan<br>
It's simple, every time I have to make a choice<br>
I just listen to my little inner voice, and he says<br>
""Shave all the hair off your butt and glue it to your nostrils""<br>
OK<br>
""Steal all the milk from all the supermarkets and put it<br>
Back in the cows""<br>
Alright<br>
""Find out which species of rodent is the most flammable""<br>
OK<br>
""Let's see what fun crafts we can make using only a chainsaw<br>
And Regis Philbin""<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
So how do I explain my little cranial expressions<br>
Intuition, premonition, or demonic possession?<br>
It could be God, an angel, or my dead uncle Paul<br>
Or that nasty purple fuzzy thing that lives in my wall<br>
Doesn't matter, and to be honest I don't wanna know<br>
'Cause thanks to him I've never had to deal with an HMO<br>
And I can go show off my rocket powered solid gold Benz<br>
I tell ya life is no much nicer with invisible friends<br>
""Record an all-banjo Falco tribute album""<br>
Done, and done.<br>
""Put on a tutu, glue two live wiener dogs to your face, and<br>
Prance around the subway terminal screaming 'Stop looking at me!'""<br>
OK<br>
""There's no reason not to have sex with a cheese grater.""<br>
Hmm, no, I suppose not.<br>
""Set up a stand outside of K-Mart with a plate full of frozen peas<br>
And a sign reading 'Take one!' If anyone asks you what the hell<br>
Your doing, give them a button that says 'I asked about the peas!'""<br>
<br>
He's become my best friend, sticks with me to the end<br>

And he's always by my side, every minute, every hour<br>
Though it does get kinda creepy when I'm trying to take a shower<br>
Still I can't complain 'cause he made me rich<br>
And figured out it was the opossum milk that made me itch<br>
If it seems weird remember the voice made me do it<br>
I don't question what he says I just get up and get to it<br>
""Itemize everything in your cat's litter box for the next seven years<br>
And mail a report to the President with a note saying 'Here!'""<br>
Good idea<br>
""It's time to find out what urinal cakes taste like""<br>
If you say so<br>
""Get a black and white horizontally striped suit, a mask,<br>
And a bowling ball with a small length of rope hanging from it,<br>
And tiptoe around the airport.""<br>
Sounds like fun<br>
""How old does a baby need to be before it's too big<br>
To fit down the toilet?""<br>
I don't know. Let's find out.<br>
""Keep swallowing magnets until your farts can erase video tapes.""<br>
Will do<br>
<br>
So to that guy in my head I just wanna say thanks<br>
For removin' my angst, so I'm no longer shootin' blanks<br>
And now I own several banks, plus an inflatable watch<br>
And paid Justin Timberlake to let me kick him in the crotch<br>
I followed his advice and now I'm makin' major duckets<br>
If it wasn't for him I'd still be processing McNuggets<br>
So when life makes you feel like you should've stayed in bed<br>
Just listen to the voice in your head, and he'll say<br>
""Fat people are full of toys. Go get some!""<br>
Yeah!<br>
""Build a 20 foot tall nude statue of Tony Goldmark licking<br>
Warm margarine off a malnourished dolphin out of onions,<br>
Pez, and lint.""<br>
With pleasure!<br>
""If Yanni didn't want to be set on fire and shoved down<br>
A flight of stairs, surely he would have said so explicitly by now.""<br>
Yeah, I guess so.<br>
""Go to a McDonald's Playland, tie that big Officier Big Mac<br>
Thing to the back of your car, and drive away at 90 mph. When a<br>
Cop pulls you over, roll down the window and indignantly ask 'WHAT?'""<br>
You got it!<br>

Miscellaneous<br>
A Christmas Song<br>
Well,um it's the holiday season<br>
And Santas' been checkin' his list to see whos' been naughty or nice<br>
And I'm kinda feelin' guilty<br>
So I wrote a song<br>
<br>
So many presents, so little time<br>
Santa won't be coming <br>
By my house this year<br>
'Cause I tried to drown my sister<br>
And I pierced my ear<br>
Oh mama made it perfectly clear<br>
Santa don't like bad boys<br>
Especially Jewish ones<br>
<br>
Skanif-kanof and Lego blocks <br>
Are what I desire<br>
So, why'd I have to set <br>
The pizza guy's hair on fire<br>
I told him I was sorry, I'm a liar<br>
So, no toys for me<br>
<br>
I don't deserve 'em<br>
I couldn't wait for a big wheel<br>
As the holiday neared<br>
But then I told my grandma<br>
That she had a beard<br>
<br>
(speaking) Dear Santa, <br>
I know what my problem is<br>
Why I can't be good<br>
It's a fear of intimacy <br>
You see, my whole life<br>
Whenever I've met someone <br>
really great like you and, <br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
I keep feeling <br>
I'm getting too close to them<br>
Something inside me<br>
Makes me want to screw it up<br>
So in a weird way<br>
The reason I'm so bad is because <br>
I love you so much Santa<br>
<br>
Rock 'em, Sock 'em robots<br>
Is what I was hopin' for<br>
But then I made a death threat<br>
To Vice President Gore<br>
Oh Santa won't be knockin' on my door<br>
'Cause he's a big fat whore<br>
What made me say that!?<br>
<br>
Chutes and Ladders<br>
Would be so good indeed<br>
So why's I have to sell <br>
That cop a bag of weed<br>
<br>
So Santa please give me<br>
My Easy Bake Oven<br>
I swear I thought Billy goats<br>
Were made for lovin'<br>
<br>
So Santa won't you<br>
Accept my appoligies<br>
Santa can't you see<br>
I'm beggin' you please<br>
Oh Santa, next year<br>
I'll do you right<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">I am a simple goat, I live on the back of a pick-up truck<br>
The old man tied me here with a 3-foot rope<br>
Am I happy he don't give a fuck<br>
Hey goat, I'm gonna beat your head in with a hickory stick<br>
<br>
Sometimes he uses his fists<br>
He's filled with anger, and filled with rage<br>
And tells me I smell like piss<br>
His drink, Jimmy Bean, his chaser, a bear<br>
After that, various alcohols<br>
That's when the beatings get so severe<br>
Asleep I pray he falls<br>
<br>
But don't feel sorry for me<br>
Things weren't always this bad<br>
Why, when I was a young talking goat<br>
The old man was just like my dad<br>
<br>
I come from the hills of Europe<br>
That's where I met the old man<br>
He was lost in the woods, I gave him directions<br>
He gave me a tuna can<br>
<br>
Then he stopped in his tracks and he said, ""Hey goat<br>
Would you like to live with me?<br>
I've got a house with a pick-up truck<br>
In a place across the sea""<br>
<br>
I said, ""Sure, why not, I've got no family<br>
You seem like a nice guy""<br>
So we went off to America<br>
The home of the apple pie<br>
<br>
On the boat, the old man told me<br>
I would be a present for his wife<br>
A talking goat, he exclaimed<br>
She'd never seen this in her life, I felt so special<br>
<br>
Well, I just couldn't believe it<br>
After all these years I finally had a friend<br>
He trimmed my beard, he scraped my hooves<br>
I prayed it would never end<br>
<br>
But when we got to his house, there was no wife<br>
Only a short, short letter<br>
It said, ""I'm leaving you for your brother<br>
Because he fucks me better""<br>
<br>
His eyes filled with tears of sadness<br>
His heart was filled with grief<br>
To soothe himself he drank a pint of Old Granddad<br>
And beat me like a side of beef<br>
<br>
I screamed, ""Send me back to the hills of Europe""<br>
He just shook his head and said, ""Nope""<br>
No one will ever leave me again<br>
To make sure, put on this 3-foot fucking rope<br>
<br>
Present day, I've been on the truck for 51 years<br>
My only friend is the am radio<br>
Sometimes the neighborhood children stop by<br>
But it's always rocks and beer bottles they throw<br>
<br>
At first they're excited to see a talking goat<br>
They gather around to hear what I have to say<br>
But I guess sometimes my stories go on too long<br>
So they leave and giggle I need a bidet<br>
<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
But you know there was a night that I did get off the truck<br>
When the old man was passed out drunk<br>
Three neighborhood kids took me to a rock 'n' roll concert<br>
The kind of music, old-school funk<br>
<br>
It was the first time I got off the truck the music made me lose control<br>
The lead singer asked if we were having fun<br>
I said, ""Fucking crank that rock 'n' roll""<br>
The women at the show were beautiful<br>
As they danced sexily on the soft grass<br>
One of them even petted my fur, fuck me in the goat-ass<br>
<br>
Then some long-haired guys grabbed me by the horns<br>
And threw me in the mosh pit<br>
They passed me around and treated me nice<br>
Till I nervously sprayed them with shit<br>
Then the music stopped and everything was quite<br>
And all the rock 'n' rollers started a fucking goat-riot<br>
<br>
Kill the goat, kill the goat<br>
Kill the goat, kill the goat<br>
<br>
They chased me under the bleachers<br>
They chased me onto the street<br>
They chased me into an alley<br>
And said, ""I was a dead fucking goat meat""<br>
<br>
But then I saw a sight that I never thought I'd see<br>
The old man swinging his hickory stick<br>
But he wasn't swinging at me<br>
""Fuck you, pot-smoking turkeys don't you press your luck""<br>
<br>
The long hairs ran away screaming as I scrambled onto the truck<br>
When we got home, the old man said, ""Goat, you broke the sacred law""<br>
No, please, sorry, shit<br>
I'll let it go this time, but if you leave again I'll break your fucking jaw<br>
Super, great, okay<br>
<br>
Thank you old man, for saving my life<br>
Thank you again and again<br>
You could have let them barbecue me<br>
But you acted like a friend<br>
<br>
""I'm not your friend, I don't even like you I'm just not drunk,"" he said<br>
To prove his point, he drank a bottle of grain alcohol<br>
And beat the fucking shit out of my head<br>
Ow, ow, you're hurting me old man<br>
<br>
That night I served a concussion<br>
Deep inside my goat brain<br>
I still cannot feel my tail bone<br>
And I'll probably never walk straight again, yeah<br>
<br>
I guess you'd call me a scapegoat<br>
A punching bag for the old man to mock<br>
Just because his wife left him<br>
For his brother's abnormally large cock<br>
<br>
He could have been my buddy<br>
But instead he's a crazy old fuck<br>
And once again, I go to sleep in my eternal home<br>
The back of the pick-up truck<br>
<br>
Goodnight, old man<br>
Yeah, goodnight goat<br></p>",The Goat Song,http://www.songlyrics.com/adam-sandler/the-goat-song-lyrics/,Adam Sandler,songlyrics,

<br>
Donald: Yes Yes. I think it would be hard to find in any sport a champion who is as beloved as this one. And the encouraging gallery goes silent. Eight strokes ahead of the pack, the Champion slowly starts his back swing.<br>
<br>
(Honking car horn)<br>
<br>
Champion: Four! (Hit the golf ball.)<br>
<br>
Donald: Oh no no! Apparently the honking horn had some sort of concentration effect on the champion's usual monstrous drive.<br>
<br>
Champion: Is that Greag normen's kid or something?<br>
<br>
(Gallery begins to laugh.)<br>
<br>
Donald: The Champion shakes it off and makes some sort of humorous remark about the horn to the gallery and they eat it up.<br>
<br>
Champion: Let's get the ball back on the field.<br>
<br>
Donald: Yes Yes, well now the Champion, his Caddy, and the elendent gallery make their way to the Champion's ball, which is unfortunately larged next to a very thick tree route. The champion and his caddy talk it over. He;s going to play it safe and punch out with a 7 iron with a 8 stroke lead this is simply smart play by the legendary Champion. He approaches the ball.. let's watch.<br>
<br>
Champion: Take a swing at the ball hitting the tree route in the process)<br>
<br>
Donald: Oh,well I.. I don't think that's what the Champion had in mind when he took that swing. The ball is now 10 yards.. um into the woods after ricoshaying off the tree route, and ther's a look of pain on the Champion's face. He is shaking his hands as if to say I did not have a strong enough grip on the club when I hit the tree route, and my hands are stinging quite badly.<br>
<br>
Champion: (Start Grunting)<br>
<br>
Donald: The Champion is starting to mutter some obscenities about the car horn, which if you just joined us blew earlier during the champion's back swing at the 18'th tee off. Well now his caddy and friend of 25 years, Mr. Skipijankings, is doing every thing he can to get the champion's mind back on track.<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: (Say line during: is doing every thing he can...) Forget about the car horn, let's just win this thing!<br>
<br>
Champion: Hahah, you're right.<br>
<br>
Donald: What wonderful veteran words of wisdom. The Champion nods in agreement, and heads into the woods to set up for his third shot which he will have to play out of a dreadfully muddy lie. He's sticking with his 7 iron closes the club face a little. He starts his swing.<br>
<br>
Champion: (Swing at ball)<br>
<br>
Donald: And the ball did not move, um if anything it's a little deeper in the mud.<br>
<br>
Champion: What is this f**king quick sand?!<br>
<br>
Donald: The Champion is now conferring with coarse marshal, David Canner.<br>
<br>
Champion: What do I do next?<br>
<br>
David: Gonna have to drop one.<br>
<br>
Donald: And yes i.. it has been ruled that his ball is unplayible, he will take a drop and a one stroke penally.<br>
<br>
Champion: (Start laughing a bit too hard as if you where drunk)<br>
<br>
Donald: and the Champion is now laughing very hard, uh one might say a little too hard, but none of the less, he drops his new Areo Fly Ball and resumes play.<br>
<br>
Gallery: (Start to clap)<br>
<br>
Donald: Back with his trusty 3 wood, the Champion lines up his shot. He starts his back swing. <br>
<br>
<br>
Champion: (Fart)<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
<br>
Donald: He flatuates. Stops his swing, and steps away from his ball, and whispers something too his caddy, Mr. Skipijankings.<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: Wha? What do you mean you got to take a Shit?<br>
<br>
Champion: I've got to shit.<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: Finish the f**king hole, we've got to win this mother f**ker!<br>
<br>
Random man in gallery: Jesus Christ man!<br>
<br>
Donald: Well now the Champion is staring angrily at his caddy. He continues to star for quite some time, and then abruptly walks back to his ball; not taking much time set up at all he swings,<br>
<br>
Champion: (Swing at the ball.)<br>
<br>
Connects, a Smash of a hit!<br>
<br>
Gallery: (applaud)<br>
<br>
Donald: Starting to slice, oh no it goes directly into the center of a man-made water hazard! <br>
<br>
Champion: You've got to be f**king kidding me!<br>
<br>
Donald: The Champion slowly walks over to his golf bag, unzips it, and pulls out, hmm what I believe is a 16 oz silver beverage container and starts drinking in large gulps. Why don't we take this time for a word from our sponcers, and then we will return to our final round coverage of the Enbuary Classic. (Whispers: Well I have no idea what he was thinking)<br>
<br>
ANNOUNCER GUY: What do 17 major championships, over 6 million dollars in prize money, and the complete domination of the sport of golf have in common? Two things: The Champion, and Areo Fly Balls. Areo Fly Balls, they just seem to go further. If it's good enough for the Champion, don't you think it's good enough for you.<br>
<br>
Donald: Well welcome back to our final round coverage of the Enbuary Classic.<br>
<br>
Random Man: (Say this during the beginning) PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON!<br>
<br>
Champion: I'll tell you one thing. no one's f**king up me in my hole.<br>
<br>
Donald: As we join the action,<br>
<br>
Champion: Because thay are f**king ugly<br>
<br>
Donald: we can see his caddy and long time friend, Mr. Skipijankings, trying to cox the Champion out of the sand trap where he is presently on his back making a snow angle.<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: Get up! GET THE F**K UP. WHAT THE F**K ARE YOU DOING?!<br>
<br>
Champion: All right( get out of hole)<br>
<br>
Donald: Well the Champion is now ceasing his softmories behavior and is climbing out of the trap onto the green.<br>
<br>
Champion: Yee-Haw! (Charge at Skipijankings and Tackle him)<br>
<br>
Donald: The Champion has just tackled long time friend, Mr. Skipijankings, I've never scene any thing like this.<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: That's it! I'm getting the F**k out of here! You're f**ked up dude, you need some help!<br>
<br>
Champion: Ya I need help f**king your wife!<br>
<br>
Skipijankings: F**k you! (Kick the Champion very hard!) Don't you EVER TALK about my wife! I'll FUKING KILL YOU MAN!<br>
<br>
Donald: Hear Hear! Generally Tempered, long time friend Mr. Skipijankings now storming off the forced hole, not with out hearing some expletive words hurled at him by the classless lord of the lace. Tears streaming down his face, the Champion is now alone on the green left with mainly a 12 foot put. (Police sirens are going off) Who would of thought that a horn honk could bring about such disaster and disarray in one ma's life. The Champion, now lining up his put, using the flag stick as his putter for some odd reason. He takes a few steps towards the hole, unbuckles his belt, The CHAMPION is defecating in the cup, and the gallery has scene enough! Not a moment too soon the police have arrived, and are advancing towards the champion slowly. In a last desperate act, the Champion holds the flag stick as if it were a large lance from medieval times, and runs full kilt in rage in his eyes towards the Officers.<br>
<br>
Officers(Begin firing guns)<br>
<br>
Donald: They Open fire. The champion has been shot. He is down on the green, he's not moving, walking inching their way towards the champion, the officer checks the champion's pulse, and signals to the other police that the Champion is sure enough dead. If you are just joining us Sunday May 7'th at 2:42 P.M. perhaps the greatest golfer of our time is diseased at age 39. My God have mercy on his sole.

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">Heres a little story<br>
about a hockey team<br>
who may just win the stanley cup<br>
but only in there dreams<br>
The team is from ottawa<br>
the senators is there name<br>
soon to be inducted in the golfing hall of fame<br>
they say they'll beat our leafers<br>
HA now there's a funny joke<br>
cause every year at playoff time<br>
the senators always choke<br>
<br>
So 3 cheers for ottawa<br>

Ottawa has their Parlament<br>

and its kinda like their hockey team<br>
they talk a lot but don't produce<br>
there not the brightest either<br>
I really have to say<br>

spells Canada with a K (hey thats kanada)<br>

So many presents,<br>
So little time,<br>
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,<br>
'cos i tried to drown my sister and i pierced my ear,<br>
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,<br>
Santa don't like bad boys...especially jewish ones.<br>
<br>
Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that i desire,<br>
So why did i have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,<br>
I told him i was sorry,<br>
I'm a liar,<br>
So no toys for me...i don't deserve them.<br>
<br>
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,<br>
But then i told my grandma that she had a beard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear santa,<br>

You see my whole life whenever i've met someone really great like you and<br>
I keep feeling like i'm getting close to them, something inside me makes<br>
Me want to screw it up. so in a weird way the reason i'm so bad is because<br>
I love you santa.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rock-em sock-em robots is what i was hoping for,<br>
But then i made a death threat to vice president gore,<br>
Oh santa won't be knocking on my door,<br>
'cos he's a big fat whore...what made me say that?<br>
<br>
Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,<br>
So why'd i have to sell that cop a bag of weed,<br>
So santa please give me that easy bake oven,<br>
I swear i thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.<br>
<br>
So santa won't you accept my apologies,<br>
Santa can't you see i'm begging you please,<br>
Oh santa next year i'll do you right,<br>

Adam Sandler<br>
<br>
Sweet Beatrice<br>
Yelling, ""I'm going to the corner store,<br>
Be back at quarter to four""<br>
""Don't slam your pinkies in the drawer""<br>
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore<br>
Hanging out at Studio 54<br>
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor<br>
With Lionel Richie<br>
Who, by the way, was a Commodore<br>
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar<br>
Who couldn't breat right since the Vietnam War<br>
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor<br>
And went camping with Eva Gabor<br>
<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
And she's coming home<br>
<br>
I got a picture of her down by the seashore<br>
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour<br>
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour<br>
With the smile of Guy LeFleur<br>
She got the ups and downs like an elevator<br>
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore<br>
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor<br>
Either or, Neithor nor<br>
She'll share it with your Labrador<br>
She can run faster than a blazing meteor<br>
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore<br>
Can make a pipe out of an apple core<br>
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish<br>
Down in Ecuador<br>
You know why?<br>
<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
And she's coming home<br>
<br>
Well, for sure she opened the door<br>
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure<br>
Sexually, that made me insecure<br>
Like the time I was a roadie<br>
On Elton John's tour<br>
She said, ""Let's go catch some Piscatore!""<br>
I said, ""Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more.""<br>
She said, ""By God, you're right!""<br>
So we took ourselves a snore<br>
And when we woke up 10 hours later<br>
We made Love Du Jour<br>
<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
She's my sweet Beatrice<br>
And she came home<br>
<br>
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then<br>
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag<br>
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie<br>
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel<br>
She gonna try on my third grade mittens<br>
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small<br>
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me<br>
She ain't never gonna let me down<br>
She ain't never gonna tell nobody<br>
I'm afraid of birds and spiders<br>
<br>
Well, Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>

Turkey for me <br>
Turkey for you <br>
Let's eat the turkey <br>
In my big brown shoe <br>
Love to eat the turkey <br>
At the table <br>
I once saw a movie <br>
With Betty Grable <br>
Eat that turkey <br>
All night long <br>
Fifty million Elvis fans <br>
Can't be wrong <br>
Turkey lurkey doo and <br>
Turkey lurkey dap <br>
I eat that turkey <br>

That's right <br>
Turkey with gravy and cranberry <br>
Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry <br>
Turkey for you and <br>
Turkey for me <br>
Can't believe Tyson <br>
Gave that girl V.D. <br>
<br>
White meat, dark meat <br>
You just can't lose <br>
I fell off my moped <br>
And I got a bruise <br>
Turkey in the oven <br>
And the buns in the toaster <br>
I'll never take down <br>
My Cheryl Tiegs poster <br>
Wrap the turkey up <br>
In aluminum foil <br>
My brother likes to masturbate <br>
With baby oil <br>
Turkey and sweet potato pie <br>
Sammy Davis Jr. <br>
Only had one eye <br>

Turkey for the girls and <br>
Turkey for the boys <br>
My favorite kind of pants <br>

There was no limit to what i could eat<br>
Shake after shake after shake after shake<br>
Followed by all kinds of red meat<br>

My body never gained to weight<br>
That pissed off all my momma's friends<br>

By calling me ""the little candy ass""<br>

Or maybe it was my momma<br>
Who got me addicted to all the wrong foods<br>

The son of Anna and Phil<br>
At 19 years old he married my mother Judy<br>
And immediately paid his first Bloomingdale's bill<br>
<br>
Right away they started on a family<br>
Three smart kids popped out of Mom's tummy<br>
But then one steamy night Dad forgot to wear his raincoat<br>
Nine months later out came the dummy<br>
<br>
But he…took care... of me<br>
<br>
Oh, Stan the Man was my hero<br>
The coolest guy ever I swear<br>
He stayed up all night making me a clay volcano<br>
That's how I won the science fair<br>
<br>
He was 6 foot 2 and 250 pounds<br>
And as sweet as he was strong<br>
He was also known to be pretty well-endowed<br>
But, believe me, he didn't pass that one along<br>
<br>
His favorite singers were Leon Redbone and Johnny Cash<br>
His favorite ballplayers were Koufax and Mickey<br>
His favorite restaurant was the Stage Delicatessan<br>
His favorite movie was Little Nicky<br>
(Sorry G-dfather 1 and 2... maybe next time)<br>
<br>
Yeah, Stan the Man was my hero<br>
With a golf swing that made men cry<br>
He'd take their money and put it in his top dresser drawer<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
Then I'd steal it so I could get high<br>
<br>
But he…beat that habit…out of me…<br>
<br>
So, Dad, thanks for letting me stay up late to watch Johnny Carson<br>
Thanks for coaching all our games at Livingston Park<br>
Thanks for telling me to always punch a kid in the face<br>
If he made an anti-Semitic remark<br>
<br>
Yeah, and don't worry about Mom we'll always look after her<br>
Me, Scott, Val, Liz and the grandkids<br>
And when Jackie and I have children of our own<br>
We'll try to raise them just the way you did.<br>
<br>
So say ""hi"" to both my grandmas and grandpas<br>
Tell my dog Meatball I miss him so<br>
But most importantly, Dad, take advantage of being in heaven<br>
And go bang Marilyn Monroe<br>
<br>
Mom said…it's cool…just wear a raincoat…<br>
<br>
Oh, Stan the Man was my hero<br>
Still is and always will be<br>
'Cause he didn't give too much a crap about nothin'<br>
Except loving his family<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">Though I have been a fool for love<br>
I have finally made my score<br>
I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast<br>
But she loves me the most<br>
Even though she's a highly paid whore<br>
She'll give head to a sheep<br>
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek<br>
But she comes home to me<br>
She'll do the groom and the best man<br>
She'll slap your ass in the back of a van<br>
But she comes home to me<br>
She could fuck nine guys in a row<br>
But still have a tenth for me<br>
And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips<br>
Unless you pay an extra fifty<br>
So mister, don't you fall in love<br>
Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove<br>
Since her heart belongs to me<br>
She has a throat that just won't quit<br>
She can take all of it<br>
And still have room for your balls<br>
but she shops in the malls for me<br>
She'll say twelve then call back and say one<br>
But I don't care I know it's just work not fun<br>
When she blows you, Jack<br>
Don't you think she's not thinking of me<br>
She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack<br>
But strictly for the cash<br>
And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee<br>
to watch her put a water bottle in her gash<br>

She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'<br>
But don't you dare try to go antique-ing<br>
Cause she does that with me<br>
Her pussy's sweet as honey<br>
But when she moans, it's just for the money<br>
Unless she's sittin' on me<br>
She'll cram your asshole with a mouse<br>
But she won't do it in our house<br>
Tough luck, Jack<br>
She knows that don't fly with me<br>
She might eat your wife's box<br>
But she won't tell ya where you left your socks<br>
She rolled up and down your fat prick<br>
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick<br>
She's got a face full of nuts<br>
And a mouth full of cocks<br>
She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,<br>
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game<br>
But they never got to know her actual name<br>
On your face she will piss<br>
On your chest she might poop<br>
But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup<br>
That's simply reserved..<br>
Oh she'll bite ya, she'll spank ya<br>
But she'll never thank you for free<br>

Miscellaneous<br>
The lone some kicker<br>
Me, I'm the Lonesome Kicker<br>
Extra points, field goals at your service<br>
One might think it comes with glory<br>
You might think different after you listen to my story<br>
<br>
My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask<br>
What it possibly could protect, I do not know<br>
The other guys on the team<br>
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads<br>
And also like to hide the special shoe<br>
I need to kick in the snow<br>
<br>
People think it's so easy<br>
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line<br>
They forget to add seven yards for the snap<br>
And 10 more 'cause the goal posts are pushed way back<br>
<br>
In 1974, the uprights were right on the goal line<br>
But some of the players were running into them<br>
And getting hurt<br>
So screw the kicker<br>
Who cares about the kicker?<br>
<br>
But I kick that ball<br>
And I pray it goes straight<br>
If it does<br>
The coach says ""Good job, number 8""<br>
He doesn't even know my name is<br>
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski, Jr.<br>
But that's the life I live<br>
The Lonesome Kicker<br>
<br>
Kickoffs can be so very scary<br>
Especially, if the returner breaks on through<br>
And I'm the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him<br>
I don't want to get hurt<br>
So I pretend to tie my shoe<br>
<br>
Once again, I'm ignored by my teammates and all my coaches<br>

Scream 70,000 fans<br>
Well, I know I could win their love back<br>
By catching a winning touch-down<br>
But, unfortunately, I was born with these very small hands<br>
<br>
And I hope that the cameras don't come in too close<br>
'Cause they might see the tears in my eyes<br>
As I sit on this bench made of cold-hearted wood<br>
And the splinters go deep in my thighs<br>
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by<br>
The Lonesome Kicker<br>
<br>
Another blocked kick<br>
And everybody blames me<br>
But it was the Left Guard<br>
Who didn't pick up his man<br>
Oh, why can't they see...<br>
<br>
In my home country<br>
I could have been a minor league soccer player<br>
But I came to America<br>
Seeking fortune and seeking fame<br>
I didn't realize that if I shanked one<br>
And blew the point spread<br>
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi<br>
After the game<br>
<br>
So I go home at night<br>
'Cause I never get invited<br>
To go drinking with the other guys<br>
And I sit in my chair, and I soak my foot<br>
As I eat a plate of cold french fries<br>
And my wife's out with her quote-unquote friend<br>
And my son can't look me in the eyes<br>
But that's the life I live<br>

Them or you'll find yourself outta of here<br>

He won’t have to pick up the phone anymore <br>
When Les Moonves calls him up<br>
He might have to take Jay Leno out for coffee <br>
Then secretly pee in his cup <br>
<br>
There’s certainly no better man <br>
Than good ol' David Letterman <br>
And no one makes my mother wetter than<br>
David Letterman <br>

(Okay Mom, I told him, I hope you’re happy) <br>

Seems like yesterday when I was 14<br>
And you looked like a freshman at Ball State<br>
Now your hairpiece is full of grey <br>
And I’m fucking 48<br>

Pets with stupid tricks will have no place to go<br>
While Paul Schafer and the band sell crack on the streets<br>
<br>
There simply is no better man<br>
Than our hero David Letterman<br>
I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done<br>
And I’m sure I ain’t the only one<br>
‘Cause you paved for every late night show<br>
Both Jimmys should get on their knees and blow<br>
<br>
(You kisses, you kisses)<br>
<br>
No more interviewing Heidi Klum or Cheryl Tiegs<br>
Now you’re just the oldest dad at little league<br>
And when you say goodbye and take your final drive<br>
In your Ferrari full of stolen office supplies<br>
And we watch you go with eyes full of tears<br>
I hope the cops pull you over and drag you back over for 30 more years<br>
<br>
‘Cause you’re the king of comedy<br>
Our best friend on TV<br>
And I’ll miss you<br>
Yeah buddy I’ll miss you<br>
The whole world’s gonna miss you <br>

Buffoon: ""this movie sucks shit!""<br>
<br>
Valedictorian: ""well, ebel gave it thumbs up, but ciscel thought it was too preachy. anyway, i enjoyed the director's last film immensly.""<br>
<br>
Buffoon: ""cathleen turner has big fuckin' tits!""<br>
<br>
Valedictorian: ""yes, well, she recently had a child. i think her maternal biology may play a role in that. she looks fabulous for a woman her age, doesn't she?""<br>
<br>
Buffoon: ""i put a firecracker in a bullfrog's mouth and blew his fuckin' head off.""<br>
<br>
Valedictorian: ""well, in psychology we learned that it is not uncommon for male adolescents to commit savage acts on animals as part of their maturing process.""<br>
<br>
Buffoon: ""that girl in the fucking car in front of us, she gives everybody head.""<br>

Dish prank.""<br>
<br>
Buffoon: ""i looked at my asshole in the mirror today. it blew my fuckin' mind!""<br>
<br>
Valedictorian: ""it's ironic that parts of one's body seems odd and unusual because you don't see them on a day to day basis.<br>

Ross and Phoebe from Friends say the Chanukah blessing<br>
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will &amp; Grace's Debra Messing<br>
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mix meat with dairy<br>
Maybe they shoulda called that show ""Little Kosher House on the Prairie""<br>
We got Jerry Lewis, Ben Stiller, and Jack Black<br>
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism, but you guys can have him back<br>

We may not get to kiss underneath the mistletoe<br>
But we can do it all night long with Deuce Bigalow, I'm Jewish<br>

Well maybe that's cuz he lost a figure skating match<br>
 to gold medalist Sarah Hughes, her mama's Jewish<br>
Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets with such precision<br>
But the one thing they could not get out of - their painful circumcisions<br>
<br>
As for half-Jewish actors, Sean Penn is quite the great one<br>
And Marlon Brando, not a Jew at all, but it looks to me like he ate one<br>
Gwenyth Paltrow's half-Jewish, but a full time Oscar winner<br>
Jennifer Conelly's half-Jewish too, and I'd like to put some more in her<br>

There's Lou Reed, Perry Ferrell, Beck, and Paula Abdul<br>
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music, but first came Hebrew School<br>
<br>
Natalie Portmonika, it's time to celebrate Chanukah<br>
I hope I get an abtronika, on this joyful, toyful Chanukah<br>

Summer Love<br>
Summer of 68,<br>
We sat on the beach and watched the seagulls fly<br>
Sunlight shining in her hair,<br>
Her eyes were bluer than the summer sky<br>
She'd hold me in her arms,<br>
And tell me everything would be alright<br>
<br>
But why'd she have to be my mother?<br>
Why'd she have to be married to my dad?     <br>
Why'd she have to be my mother?<br>
We could have been so much more but she said it was best if we were just friends<br>
Oh, Summer Love<br>
<br>
Summer of 73, my second love,<br>
We met on the field behind the school<br>
We used to play all day in the sun,<br>
No one ever made me feel that cool<br>
I'll never forget the way<br>
She looked in those silky shorts that day<br>
<br>
But why'd she have to be my gym teacher?     <br>
Why'd she have to be fifty-one years old?     <br>
Why'd she have to be my gym teacher?<br>
I told her I wanted to play flag football with her forever,<br>
But she told me to go and see the school psychologist<br>

I've made some mistakes in the past,<br>
But I'll put them behind me and pick up the phone<br>
And call the woman who<br>
I should have been going out with all along<br>
<br>
I'm gonna go out with my mother<br>
I know what I said before but I think I can talk her into it this time<br>

I didn't like to dance, I was shy<br>
I'd stand against the wall all night<br>
I'd never take a chance, so afraid<br>
<br>
I wouldn't get on that dance floor<br>
Unless I was really drunk, 10 shots<br>
But I found a place where the stars hang out<br>
And they taught me how to funk<br>
<br>
Real nasty, it ain't too far away<br>
It's just on the edge of town, nearby<br>
But be ready when you get there<br>
'Cause these folks don't fuck around<br>
<br>
You can, rub your belly with Liza Minelli<br>
Covered in jelly, you're gonna rub your belly<br>
Jiggle your droopy balls with singin' Lou Rawis<br>
Bounce off the walls, then jiggle them droopy balls<br>
<br>
Grind your hips with the blond guy from CHIPS<br>
Lick your lips<br>
Stroke it clean with Martin Sheen<br>
It's fucking obscene<br>
<br>
Clench your ass-cheeks tight<br>
With sexy grandma Betty White<br>
You'll see the light when your sphincter's tight<br>
<br>
If you don't know how to move<br>
Just feel the groove<br>
And dance, like you just shit your pants<br>
<br>
Spin like a little girl<br>
With cross-dressing Milton Berle<br>
Just give it a whirl<br>
Pretend you're a little girl<br>

Wave that juicy weeno with legendary Al Pacino<br>
Wave your weeno, even more obsceno<br>
Knock back a drink with Colonel Klink<br>

Put on my new plastic glove<br>

With a little slice of love<br>
Got no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of<br>
Just know everything's doing fine<br>

That i woke up to see<br>
All the pepperoni pizza<br>
Was a-looking at me<br>
It screamed, why do you burn me<br>
And serve me up cold<br>
I said i got the spatula<br>
Just do what you're told<br>
Then the liver &amp; onions<br>
Started joining the fight<br>
And the chocolate pudding<br>
Pushed me with all its might<br>
And the chop suey slapped me<br>
And it kicked me in the head<br>
It's called revenge lunchlady<br>
Said the garlic bread<br>
I said what did i do<br>
To make you all so mad<br>
They said you got flabby arms<br>
And your breath is bad<br>
Then the green beans said<br>
You better run and hide<br>
But then my friend sloppy joe came<br>
And joined my side<br>
He said if it wasn't for the lunchlady<br>
The kids wouldn't eatcha<br>
You should be shakin' her hand<br>
And sayin' please to meet ya<br>
She gives you a purpose<br>
And she gives you a goal<br>
You should be kissin' her feet<br>
And kissin' her mole<br>
Now all the angry foods<br>
Just leave me alone<br>
And we all live together<br>
In a happy home<br>

I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype<br>
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it<br>

"<p id=""songLyricsDiv"" class=""songLyricsV14 iComment-text"">What's your name?<br>
<br>
Me, I'm the lonesome kicker<br>
Extra points, field goals at your service<br>
One might think it comes with glory<br>
You might think different after you listen to my story<br>
<br>
My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask<br>
What it possibly could protect, I do not know<br>
The other guys on the team<br>
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads<br>
And also like to hide the special shoe<br>
I need to kick in the snow<br>
<br>
People think it's so easy<br>
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line<br>
They forget to add seven yards for the snap<br>
And 10 more 'cause the goal posts are pushed way back<br>
<br>
In 1974, the uprights were right on the goal line<br>
But some of the players were running into them and getting hurt<br>
So screw the kicker<br>
Who cares about the kicker?<br>
<br>
But I kick that ball and I pray it goes straight<br>
If it does coach says, ""Good job, number 8""<br>
He doesn't even know my name is<br>
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski, Jr<br>
But that's the life I live the lonesome kicker<br>
<br>
Kickoffs can be so very scary<br>
Especially, if the returner breaks on through<br>
And I'm the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him<br>
I don't want to get hurt so I pretend to tie my shoe<br>

Well, I know I could win their love back<br>
By catching a winning touch-down<br>
But, unfortunately, I was born with these very small hands<br>
<br>
And I hope that the cameras don't come in too close<br>
'Cause they might see the tears in my eyes<br>
As I sit on this bench made of cold-hearted wood<br>
And the splinters go deep in my thighs<br>
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by, the lonesome kicker<br>
<br>
Another blocked kick<br>
And everybody blames me<br>
But it was the left guard<br>
Who didn't pick up his man<br>
Oh, why can't they see<br>
<br>
In my home country<br>
I could have been a minor league soccer player<br>
But I came to America seeking fortune and seeking fame<br>
I didn't realize that if I shanked one and blew the point spread<br>
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi after the game<br>
<br>
So I go home at night 'cause I never get invited<br>
To go drinking with the other guys<br>
And I sit in my chair, and I soak my foot<br>
As I eat a plate of cold French fries<br>
And my wife's out with her quote-unquote friend<br>
And my son can't look me in the eyes<br>
But that's the life I live, the lonesome kicker<br>
<br>
Kicking for you<br>
They took my snow shoe<br>
They're going for two<br></p>",The Lonesome Kicker,http://www.songlyrics.com/adam-sandler/the-lonesome-kicker-lyrics/,Adam Sandler,songlyrics,

What's Your Name?<br>
Sweat Beatrice<br>
Performed by adam sandler, allen covert, and jon rosenburg<br>
<br>
Hanging with my sweet amour<br>
She came out with a lion's roar<br>
Yelling, ""i'm going to the corner store,<br>
Be back at quarter to four""<br>
""don't slam your pinkies in the drawer""<br>
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore<br>
Hanging out at studio 54<br>
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor<br>
With lionel richie<br>
Who, by the way, was a commodore<br>
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar<br>
Who couldn't breat right since the vietnam war<br>
Then she played chinese checkers with skeletor<br>
And went camping with eva gabor<br>
<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
And she's coming home<br>
<br>
I got a picture of her down by the seashore<br>
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour<br>
Her hair's up like conway twitty's pompadour<br>
With the smile of guy lefleur<br>
She got the ups and downs like an elevator<br>
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore<br>
Can bake a cake as big as jupitor<br>
Either or, neithor nor<br>
She'll share it with your labrador<br>
She can run faster than a blazing meteor<br>
Loves winnie the pooh and his friend eeyore<br>
Can make a pipe out of an apple core<br>
That's a trick she learned from roberto parrish<br>
Down in ecuador<br>
You know why?<br>
<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
And she's coming home<br>
<br>
Well, for sure she opened the door<br>
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure<br>
Sexually, that made me insecure<br>
Like the time i was a roadie<br>
On elton john's tour<br>
She said, ""let's go catch some piscatore!""<br>
I said, ""beatrice, you don't eat fish no more.""<br>
She said, ""by god, you're right!""<br>
So we took ourselves a snore<br>
And when we woke up 10 hours later<br>
We made love du jour<br>
<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
She's my sweet beatrice<br>
And she came home<br>
<br>
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then<br>
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag<br>
We gonna watch ourselves a john wayne movie<br>
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel<br>
She gonna try on my third grade mittens<br>
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small<br>
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me<br>
She ain't never gonna let me down<br>
She ain't never gonna tell nobody<br>
I'm afraid of birds and spiders<br>
<br>
Well, bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice<br>
