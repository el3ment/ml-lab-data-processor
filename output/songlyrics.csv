Two men out and three men on<br>
Nowhere to look but inside<br>

You're Only Human (Second Wind)<br>
                <br>
<br>
You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good<br>
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood<br>
It's alright, it's alright, sometimes that's what it takes<br>
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes<br>
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)<br>
<br>
You better believe there will be times in your life<br>
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool<br>
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents<br>
Than anything that you could ever learn at school<br>
<br>
Don't forget your second wind<br>
Sooner of later you'll get your second wind<br>
<br>
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain<br>
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again<br>
It's alright, it's alright, though you feel your heart break<br>
You're only human, you're gonna have to deal with heartache<br>
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)<br>
<br>
Just like a boxer in a title fight<br>
You got to walk in that ring all alone<br>
You're not the only one who's made mistakes<br>

You've been keeping to yourself these days<br>
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong<br>
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die<br>
That emotion can be so strong<br>
But hold on 'till that old second wind comes along<br>
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)<br>
<br>
You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else<br>
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself<br>
It's alright, it's alright, sometimes that's all it takes<br>
We're only human, we're supposed to make mistakes<br>
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)<br>
<br>
But I survived all those long lonely days<br>
When it seemed I did not have a friend<br>
Cause all I needed was a little faith<br>
So I could catch my breath and face the world again<br>
<br>
Don't forget your second wind<br>
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in<br>
(One more time!)<br>
Don't forget your second wind<br>
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in<br>

Prelude Angry Young Man<br>
There's a place in the world for the angry young man<br>
With his working class ties and his radical plans<br>
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl,<br>
He's always at home with his back to the wall.<br>
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost,<br>
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross<br>
And he likes to be knowns as the angry young man.<br>
<br>
Give a moment or two to the angry young man,<br>
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand.<br>
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood,<br>
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good.<br>
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door,<br>
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor<br>

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage<br>
I found that just surviving was a noble fight.<br>
I once believed in causes too,<br>
I had my pointless point of view,<br>
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right.<br>
<br>
And there's always a place for the angry young man,<br>
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand.<br>
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes,<br>
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks.<br>
But his honor is pure and his courage as well,<br>
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell<br>

River Of Dreams<br>
In the middle of the night <br>
I go walking in my sleep <br>
From the mountains of faith <br>
To a river so deep <br>
<br>
I must be looking for something <br>
Something sacred I lost <br>
But the river is wide <br>
And it's too hard to cross <br>
<br>
And even though I know the river is wide <br>
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore <br>
And try to cross to the opposite side <br>
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for <br>
<br>
In the middle of the night <br>
I go walking in my sleep <br>
Through the valley of fear <br>
To a river so deep <br>
<br>
And I've been searching for something <br>
Taken out of my soul <br>
Something I would never lose <br>
Something somebody stole <br>
<br>
I don't know why I go walking at night <br>
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore <br>
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life <br>

I go walking in my sleep <br>
Through the jungle of doubt <br>
To a river so deep <br>

Something so undefined <br>
That it can only be seen <br>
By the eyes of the blind <br>
<br>
In the middle of the night <br>
<br>
I'm not sure about a life after this <br>
God knows I've never been a spiritual man <br>
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river <br>
That runs to the promised land <br>
<br>
In the middle of the night <br>
I go walking in my sleep <br>
Through the desert of truth <br>
To the river so deep <br>

We all end in the ocean <br>
We all start in the streams <br>
We're all carried along <br>

You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes <br>
You better believe there will be times in your life <br>
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool <br>
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents <br>
Than anything that you could ever learn at school <br>
<br>
Don't forget your second wind <br>
Sooner of later you'll get your second wind <br>
<br>
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain <br>
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again <br>
It's alright, it's alright <br>
Though you feel your heart break <br>
You're only human, you're gonna have to deal with heartache <br>
<br>
Just like a boxer in a title fight <br>
You got to walk in that ring all alone <br>
You're not the only one who's made mistakes <br>
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own <br>

Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in <br>
<br>
You've been keeping to yourself these days <br>
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong <br>
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die <br>
That emotion can be so strong <br>
But hold on <br>
Till that old second wind comes along <br>
<br>
You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else <br>
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself <br>
It's alright, it's alright <br>
Sometimes that's all it takes <br>
We're only human <br>
We're supposed to make mistakes <br>
But I survived all those long lonely days <br>
When it seemed I did not have a friend <br>
Cause all I needed was a little faith <br>
So I could catch my breath and face the world again <br>
<br>
Don't forget your second wind <br>
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in <br>

Scenes From An Italian Kitchen<br>
Billy Joel<br>
<br>
A bottle of white, a bottle of red<br>
Perhaps a bottle of rose instead<br>
We'll get a table near the street<br>
In our old familiar place<br>
You and I, face to face<br>
<br>
A bottle of red, a bottle of white<br>
It all depends on your appetite<br>
I'll meet you any time you want<br>
In our Italian Restaurant.<br>
<br>
Things are okay with me these days<br>
Got a good job, got a good office<br>
Got a new wife, got a new life<br>
And the family's fine<br>
We lost touch long ago<br>
You lost weight I did not know<br>
You could ever look so good after<br>
So much time.<br>
<br>
I remember those days hanging out<br>
At the village green<br>
Engineer boots, leather jackets<br>
And tight blue jeans<br>
Drop a dime in the box play the<br>
Song about New Orleans<br>
Cold beer, hot lights<br>
My sweet romantic teenage nights<br>
<br>
Brenda and Eddie were the<br>
Popular steadies<br>
And the king and the queen<br>
Of the prom<br>
Riding around with the car top<br>
Down and the radio on<br>
Nobody looked any finer<br>
Or was more of a hit at the<br>
Parkway Diner<br>
We never knew we could want more<br>
Than that out of life<br>
Surely Brenda and Eddie would<br>
Always know how to survive.<br>
<br>
Brenda and Eddy were still going<br>
Steady in the summer of '75<br>
when they decided the marriage would<br>
Be at the end of July<br>
Everyone said they were crazy<br>
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy<br>
Eddie could never afford to live that<br>
Kind of life.""<br><img src=""http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif"" style=""display:none;"" onload=""var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);""><br>
But there we were wavin' Brenda and<br>
Eddie goodbye.<br>
<br>
They got an apartment with deep <br>
Pile carpet<br>
And a couple of paintings from Sears<br>
A big waterbed that they bought<br>
With the bread<br>
They had saved for a couple<br>
Of years<br>
They started to fight when the<br>
Money got tight<br>
And they just didn't count on<br>
The tears.<br>
<br>
They lived for a while in a<br>
Very nice style<br>
But it's always the same in the end<br>
They got a divorce as a matter<br>
Of course<br>
And they parted the closest<br>
Of friends<br>
Then the king and the queen went<br>
Back to the green<br>
But you can never go back<br>
There again.<br>
<br>
Brenda and Eddie had had it<br>
Already by the summer of '75<br>
From the high to the low to<br>
The end of the show<br>
For the rest of their lives<br>
They couldn't go back to<br>
The greasers<br>
The best they could do was<br>
Pick up the pieces<br>
We always knew they would both<br>
Find a way to get by<br>
That's all I heard about<br>
Brenda and Eddie<br>
Can't tell you more than I<br>
Told you already<br>
And here we are wavin' Brenda<br>
And Eddie goodbye.<br>

We left as inmates<br>

As sharp as knives<br>

To lay down our lives<br>

We left in plastic<br>
As numbered corpses<br>
And we learned fast<br>
To travel light<br>
Our arms were heavy<br>
But our bellies were tight<br>

We had no home front<br>
We had no soft soap<br>
They sent us Playboy<br>
They gave us Bob Hope<br>
We dug in deep<br>
And shot on sight<br>
And prayed to Jesus Christ<br>
With all our might<br>

We had no cameras<br>

Remember Baker<br>

On every acre<br>
And who was wrong?<br>
And who was right?<br>

We held the day<br>
In the palm<br>
Of our hand<br>
<br>
They ruled the night<br>
And the night<br>
Seemed to last as long as six weeks<br>
On Parris Island<br>
We held the coastline<br>
They held the highlands<br>
And they were sharp<br>
As sharp as knives<br>
They heard the hum of our motors<br>
They counted the rotors<br>
And waited for us to arrive<br>

Fallin' Of The Rain<br>
Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams <br>
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes <br>
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed<br>
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain <br>
<br>
In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids <br>
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade<br>
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang<br>
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain <br>
<br>
Will it always be the same as we recall? <br>
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall? <br>
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see <br>
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me <br>

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy <br>
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool <br>
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits <br>
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain <br>
<br>
Will it always be the same as we recall? <br>
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall? <br>
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see <br>

<br>
So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day <br>
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away <br>
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed <br>

About a woman and a man<br>
Maybe you will find familiar<br>
Maybe you won't understand<br>
<br>
The man's name I don't remember<br>
He was always Joe to me<br>
But I can't forget the woman<br>
She was always Christie Lee<br>
<br>
He was working in a night club<br>
That's where he played the saxophone<br>
He used to fake to stock arrangements<br>
He left the customers alone<br>
<br>
But one night before the last song<br>
About a quarter after three<br>
He saw her standing at the coat check<br>
And made his move on Christie Lee<br>
<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>
<br>
She was a nice piece of music<br>
She had a rhythm all her own<br>
He blew a solo like a blind man<br>
She really dug his saxophone<br>
<br>
She wanted more than just an encore<br>
And he could play in every key<br>
He left the stage and packed his alto<br>
And he took it home with Christie Lee<br>

You know the man could blow an educated axe<br>
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman<br>
Who didn't need another lover<br>
All she wanted was the sax<br>
<br>
It took a while for him to notice<br>
It took a while for him to see<br>
He was never in control here<br>
It was always Christie Lee<br>

Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>

Yes the man had the power to perform<br>
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle<br>
She didn't need him as a man<br>
All she wanted was the horn<br>
<br>
They say that Joe became a wino<br>
They say he always drinks alone<br>
They say he stumbles like a blind man<br>
They say he sold his saxophone<br>

Even the band must face the music<br>

Parkway Diner <br>
We never knew we could want more <br>
Than that out of life <br>
Surely Brenda and Eddie would <br>
Always know how to survive. <br>
<br>
Brenda and Eddy were still going <br>
Steady in the summer of '75 <br>
when they decided the marriage would <br>
Be at the end of July <br>
Everyone said they were crazy <br>
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy <br>
Eddie could never afford to live that <br>
Kind of life."" <br>

Eddie goodbye. <br>
<br>
They got an apartment with deep <br>
Pile carpet <br>
And a couple of paintings from Sears <br>
A big waterbed that they bought <br>
With the bread <br>
They had saved for a couple <br>
Of years <br>
They started to fight when the <br>
Money got tight <br>
And they just didn't count on <br>
The tears. <br>
<br>
They lived for a while in a <br>
Very nice style <br>
But it's always the same in the end <br>
They got a divorce as a matter <br>
Of course <br>
And they parted the closest <br>
Of friends <br>
Then the king and the queen went <br>
Back to the green <br>
But you can never go back <br>
There again. <br>
<br>
Brenda and Eddie had had it <br>
Already by the summer of '75 <br>
Fromhe high to the low to <br>
The end of the show <br>
For the rest of their lives <br>
They couldn't go back to <br>
The greasers <br>
The best they could do was <br>
Pick up the pieces <br>
We always knew they would both <br>
Find a way to get by <br>
That's all I heard about <br>
Brenda nd Eddie <br>
Can't tell you more than I <br>
Told you already <br>
And here we are wavin' Brenda <br>
And Eddie goodbye. <br>

Were still a recent surprise<br>
And we were flying over<br>
Scandinavian Skies<br>
We climbed towards the sun<br>
We turned and cursed as one<br>
We pulled the shades<br>
And closed our eyes<br>
