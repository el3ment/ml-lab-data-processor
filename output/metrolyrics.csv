Calls me<br>
In the middle of the night<br>
Passes on her<br>
Painful information<br>
Then these careless fingers<br>
They get caught in her vice<br>
Til they're bleeding<br>
On my coffee table<br>

It's cracked up to be<br>

Been one long disaster<br>

Some aggressive action<br>

While she's slamming her doors<br>
In my face<br>
Failure to break<br>
Was the only mistake<br>
That she made<br>
Here I am<br>
feeling like a fucking fool<br>
Do I react the way exactly<br>
She intends me to?<br>

She makes me lose my cool<br>

Calls me<br>

All her questions<br>
Will get sympathetic answers<br>
I should<br>
Be so<br>
Immunized<br>
To all of her tricks<br>

On her second chances<br>

Godfather deal is all wrong<br>
How can she hold an umbilical chord<br>
For so long?<br>
I've done everything I can<br>
What else am I supposed to do<br>

Loves me<br>
Even if I don't care<br>
That's my problem<br>
That's her sacred absolution<br>

She would put herself in my chair<br>

Faced electrocution<br>

<p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night<br>
I go walking in my sleep<br>
From the mountains of faith<br>
To a river so deep</p><p class=""verse"">I must be looking for something<br>
Something sacred I lost<br>
But the river is wide<br>
And it's too hard to cross</p><p class=""verse"">And even though I know the river is wide<br>
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore<br>
And try to cross to the opposite side<br>
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for</p><p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night<br>
I go walking in my sleep<br>
Through the valley of fear<br>
To a river so deep</p><p class=""verse"">And I've been searching for something<br>
Taken out of my soul<br>
Something I would never lose<br>
Something somebody stole</p><p class=""verse"">I don't know why I go walking at night<br>
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore<br>
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life<br>
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for</p><p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night<br>
I go walking in my sleep<br>
Through the jungle of doubt<br>
To a river so deep</p><p class=""verse"">I know I'm searching for something<br>
Something so undefined<br>
That it can only be seen<br>
By the eyes of the blind</p><p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night</p><p class=""verse"">I'm not sure about a life after this<br>
God knows I've never been a spiritual man<br>
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river<br>
That runs to the promised land</p><p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night<br>
I go walking in my sleep<br>
Through the desert of truth<br>
To the river so deep</p><p class=""verse"">We all end in the ocean<br>
We all start in the streams<br>
We're all carried along<br>
By the river of dreams</p><p class=""verse"">In the middle of the night</p>	</div>",The River Of Dreams,http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-river-of-dreams-lyrics-the-sing-off.html,The Sing Off,metrolyrics,

<p class=""verse"">Some folks like to get away,<br>
Take a holiday from the neighborhood.<br>
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood.<br>
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line.<br>
I'm in a New York state of mind.<br>
I've seen all the movie stars in their fancy cars and their limousines.<br>
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens.<br>
I know what I'm needin', and I don't want to waste more time.<br>
I'm in a New York state of mind.</p><p class=""verse"">It was so easy livin' day by day<br>
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues<br>
But now I need a little give and take<br>
The New York Times, the Daily News.</p><p class=""verse"">It comes down to reality, and its fine with me cause I've let it slide.<br>
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside.<br>
I don't have any reasons.<br>
I left them all behind.<br>

<p class=""verse"">Slow down, you crazy child<br>
you're so ambitious for a juvenile<br>
But then if you're so smart, tell me<br>
Why are you still so afraid?</p><p class=""verse"">Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?<br>
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out<br>
You've got so much to do and<br>
Only so many hours in a day</p><p class=""verse"">But you know that when the truth is told..<br>
That you can get what you want or you get old<br>
You're gonna kick off before you even<br>
Get halfway through<br>
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?</p><p class=""verse"">Slow down, you're doing fine<br>
You can't be everything you want to be<br>
Before your time<br>
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight<br>
Tonight,...<br>
Too bad but it's the life you lead<br>
you're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need<br>
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know<br>
You can't always see when you're right. you're right</p><p class=""verse"">You've got your passion, you've got your pride<br>
but don't you know that only fools are satisfied?<br>
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true<br>
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?</p><p class=""verse"">Slow down, you crazy child<br>
and take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile<br>
it's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two<br>
When will you realize,..Vienna waits for you?<br>
And you know that when the truth is told<br>
that you can get what you want or you can just get old<br>
You're gonna kick off before you even get half through<br>
Why don't you realize,. Vienna waits for you<br>

<p class=""verse"">Im not mad<br>
Im just tired and it makes me sad<br>
At least it makes me something different<br>
I hate this place and all these guys<br>
And their fancy clothes<br>
It doesn't seem like music at all</p><p class=""verse"">I'll speak the truth so<br>
You know I mean it<br>
I'll take my time so,<br>
You know I mean it<br>
You know I mean it</p><p class=""verse"">All the things ive seen<br>
Just sing to me<br>
To convince to me, my deep belief<br>
There is a difference<br>
There is a difference</p><p class=""verse"">This place is built of men<br>
People who crush our hope (the things that make it different)<br>
Our eyes, nobody owns<br>
My eyes, just body and soul (it makes no difference)<br>
Would you believe if you dont stand up<br>
And make a difference<br>
And now you really want to wanna burn me<br>
You really wanna but its much easier</p><p class=""verse"">You look the same and sound the same<br>
You play the game and I want to misbehave<br>
And im not that different<br>
