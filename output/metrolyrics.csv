Official lock family, grants niggaz handin me<br>
I want the finer things, and I hope you understandin me<br>
Sittin at the table, plannin and plug the fan in<br>
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon<br>
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless<br>
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like pesci<br>
And if rap was hockey, I be gretzky, puffin nestle<br>
Any ya niggaz done started somethin<br>
Actin invincible like you God or somethin<br>
If you god, then i'ma makes a lot til you rot<br>
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got<br>
And if you a thug, then start bustin off shots<br>

Don't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution<br>
Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions<br>
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering<br>

How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit<br>
See if your hardest niggaz flip, when I start a bunch of shit<br>
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet<br>
Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggaz see sheep<br>
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud<br>
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood<br>
A positive I'd is impossible, so you know<br>
John doe is what they gon' be puttin on that tag on yo' toe<br>
Now who gon tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue<br>
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs<br>

but in one episode of the show there was a flashback of Brian<br>
when he was a puppy. Now, they couldnt find a puppy<br>
who looked enough like him,<br>
so they actually built a dog suit for the scene,<br>
and the actor of inside the suit was Raven-Symon,<br>
who was Olivia on the Cosby show.<br>
Brian: Fascinating bit of trivia.<br>
Peter: All right, okay, I got one for ya.<br>
You know the sound stage where we shoot Family Guy<br>
is the same stage where they shot the Golden Girls<br>
back in the 80s, right?<br>
Now one of the stage hands was telling me a- a pretty intense story.<br>
I guess there was one night when they were all ready to shoot,<br>
and uh, the audience was waiting. And uh, nobody could find Bea Arthur.<br>
So everybodys freaking out and uh, then one of the producers runs in<br>
and says ""Cancel the show tonight. Bea Arthurs in jail!<br>

before the show and uh, they found her standing on the street corner,<br>

and then they come out to Hollywood and just go fucking berserk.<br>
Brian: You gotta watch your language, kid.<br>
Stewie: Oh, its a record album for Gods sake.<br>
Lets cut loose a bit.<br>
Chris: Nipples! Hehe.<br>
Stewie: Perfect example.<br>
Although I must say I am amazed at the language you can get away with<br>
on television these days. I- I was watching Law and Order the other night<br>
and I swear to god, I heard someone use the word balls.<br>
And I thought to myself, ""My God, that- that Dick Wolf just does<br>
whatever he damn well pleases, doesnt he?<br>

I wonder how he'd like it if I just walked into his living room<br>

I am so glad they allowed us to bring Stewie this evening.<br>
The last show we did we had to leave him at home.<br>

We hit a couple divvy little bars<br>
We noticed there was quite a lovely lady<br>
Sittin' at the table next to ours</p><p class=""verse"">Now Barney, who was pretty friggin' wasted<br>
Got up and stumbled over with a groan<br>
He said, ""Hey, just between us, my Neanderthalic penis<br>
Is as massive as a Stegosaurus bone!</p><p class=""verse"">All cartoons are fuckin' dicks<br>

Oh, yeah! He is a bastard<br>

He wore a little hat and matching bow tie<br>

Some soda and some chips and other stuff<br>

I wasn't ready and I said,""no!""<br>

Once upon a time, about a week ago,<br>
All of a sudden, trouble started to grow.<br>
Alarm was buzzin', I was snoozin',<br>
S'posed to get up now, but I was refusin'<br>
To let reality become an intrusion,<br>
'Cause in dreamy-dream land, I was cruisin'.<br>
But the buzz kept buzzin', my head kept buzzin'.<br>
Gave the radio a throw, and heard an explosion.<br>
(Homer: D'oh!)<br>
Opened up my eyes, and to my surprise,<br>
There stood Homer, and his temperature risin'.<br>
I was chillin', he was yellin',<br>
Face all distorted, 'cause he was propellin'.<br>
It wasn't what he said, but more of his tone,<br>
The usual jive, put your nose to the grindstone.<br>
I said ""I'm real sorry"" but that didn't cut it,<br>
I started to protest, but Dad said<br>
Homer: Shut it.<br>
Get up. Mow the lawn. Move it. On the double.<br>

Now you can't go to the boatshow.</p><p class=""verse"">Bart: This is my thanks after working my butt off?<br>

<p class=""verse"">As the sun shines down on the land so her heart is crying for love<br>
And there is no-one there, no-one to hear her voice and she will sleep alone again tonight<br>
Now the moon is high in the sky<br>
In her room she calls out his name<br>
But he is somewhere else somewhere she cannot see<br>
Oh and the night is dark between them now<br>
'my god, my god, why did he go away? '<br>
Now the sun shines on a new town<br>
With a smile he gets off the train<br>
He lights a cigarette leans back to see the sky<br>
Oh and he thinks how much better off he is without her hanging round<br>
Let's do it<br>
And the day is passing by him and he has nowhere to stay<br>
At a lonely bar-room table his mind goes back to yesterday to the girl who's dead and<br>
Buried<br>
But her face lives in his eyes<br>
He must forget that face forever<br>
Make the future start tonight<br>
Forget her<br>
But the meal he eats is dead flesh<br>
There is cancer in his cigarettes and the drinks won't do a thing for him<br>
But revive some stupid memories<br>
Then a hairstyle that reminds him makes him run into the night<br>
Where the moon hangs high above him now<br>
The same moon that she's praying on tonight<br>
But the wind catches her words and the moon swallows them whole<br>
Now the moon is high in the sky<br>
In her room she calls out his name<br>
The night is cold and dark and she is all alone<br>
The bed is empty now<br>
Her body screams for love<br>
She wants to be with him<br>
Oh but he's so far away<br>
Oh and the night is dark between them now<br>

<p class=""verse"">Susan catches the bus into town at ten-thirty a.m. she sits on the back seat. she looks at<br>
The man in front's head and thinks how his fat wrinkled neck is like a large carrot<br>
Sticking out from the collar of his shirt. she adds up the numbers on her bus ticket to<br>
See if they make twenty-one, but they don't. maybe she shouldn't bother going to school at<br>
All, then. her friends will be in the yard with their arms folded on their chests,<br>
Shielding their breasts to try and make them look bigger, whilst the boys will be too busy<br>
Playing football to notice. the bus is waiting on the high street when suddenly it begins<br>
To rain torrentially and it sounds like someone has emptied about a million packets of<br>
Dried peas on top of the roof of the bus. 'what if it just keeps raining,' she<br>
Thinks to herself, 'and it was just like being in an aquarium except it was all the<br>
Shoppers and office-workers that were floating passed the window instead of fish? '<br>
She's still thinking about this when the bus goes passed caroline lee's house where there<br>
Was a party last week. there were some german exchange students there who were very<br>
Mature; they all ended up jumping out of the bedroom window. one of them tried to get her<br>
To kiss him on the stairs, so she kicked him. later she was sick because she drunk too<br>
Much cider. caroline was drunk as well; she was pretending she was married to a tall boy<br>
In glasses, and she had to wear a polo-neck for three days afterwards to cover up the<br>
Love-bite on her neck. by now the bus is going passed the market. outside is a man who<br>
Spends all day forcing felt-tip pens into people's hands and then trying to make them pay<br>
For them. she used to work in the pet shop, but she got sacked for talking to boys when<br>
She was supposed to be working. she wasn't too bothered though, she hated the smell of the<br>
Rabbits anyway. 'maybe this bus won't stop,' she thinks, 'and I'll stay on<br>
It until I'm old enough to go into pubs on my own. or it could drive me to a town where<br>
People with black hair drink special brew and I can make lots of money by charging fat old<br>
Men five pounds a time to look up my skirt. oh, they'll be queuing up to take me out to<br>
Dinner...' I suppose you think she's just a silly girl with stupid ideas, but i<br>
Remember her in those days. they talk about people with a fire within and all that stuff,<br>
Well, she had that alright. it's just that no-one dared to jump into her fire; they would<br>

<p class=""verse"">""A real kitchen sink drama. This kind of thing happens all the time and it<br>
leaves a nasty stain on the shag-pile."" Starts so slowly, just a place to<br>
stay... Somewhere warm where they can spend their days. Air is stagnant<br>
and he feels unclean. Hair hangs greasy and he smells obscene.<br>
Something's happened and it's not so good, broken bottles in the face of<br>
love. Mottled flesh under the harsh strip light. Nylong sheets to keep<br>
them warm at night. Once it's started it can never stop, fills his heaf<br>
with a dark damp fog. In the distance is a constant cry, growing louder as<br>
the years go by, days get longer and he starts to drunk, spews his stomach<br>
in the kitchen sink. Tells his children they should have respect, tells<br>
his wife she's a nervous wreck. He hates his wife and he hates them all.<br>
He hates his wife and he hates them all. Can't be bothered when it's all<br>
the same, leave it long enough; it goes away. In the meantime stomach<br>
turns to fat. She tries to tell him but he can't have that. She's only<br>
jealous and she's telling lies. Standing naked in his flesh disguise. It<br>
took him years to get her into bed; now he's got her he just wants her<br>
dead. She wants excitement and she needs romance, all she gets is dirty<br>
underpants. Stupid animal that can't know why, something's wrong so<br>
someone has to die. The wind is blowing and the rain falls down, sends his<br>
family on a trip downtown. Sees them die in a burning wreck. Sees them<br>
burn, smokes a cigarette. He hates his wife and he hates them all. He<br>
knows he's finished but he can't stop now and he wants to end it but he<br>
can't see how and it's all in pieces, thrown it all away. Ih, but he's not<br>
ugly he just looks that way. And he wants some quiet and he needs it now<br>
but the scream he started's getting far too loud. He still pretends he<br>
does it just for now; his day will come he'll lose it all somehow. Killing<br>
time until his ship arrives; been dead 10 years but he's still alive. And<br>
the time is wasted and the ship has sunk but he hasn;t noticed and he comes<br>
home drunk. He's just dead weight he'll never leave the ground, he tries<br>
to stand but he keeps falling down. It's hard to know he doesn't count for<br>
much. He's not a has-been; just a never-was. He hates his wife and he<br>
hates them all.</p>	</div>",Aborigine,http://www.metrolyrics.com/aborigine-lyrics-pulp.html,Pulp,metrolyrics,

Little masters coughing their lungs up<br>
And globules, the color of tomato ketchup<br>

Through dirty brickwork conduits<br>
Connecting white witches on the Moor<br>
With Pre-Raphaelites, down in Broom hall</p><p class=""verse"">Beneath the old Trebor factory<br>

Beneath pudgy fifteen year olds addicted to coffee whitener<br>

But none of the kids seemed interested in riding it</p><p class=""verse"">And the cafe was still there too<br>
The same press-in plastic letters on the price list<br>
And scuffed Formica-top tables<br>

Except you were somebody else<br>

To jump off the viaduct into the river<br>
When coming home from the pub on a Saturday night</p><p class=""verse"">But that this custom had died out<br>
When someone jumped and landed too near to the riverbank<br>

Nettles that sting but not too much</p><p class=""verse"">I've never been past this point<br>

About making my way back<br>

<p class=""verse"">You know sometimes...when we're lying together...<br>
And I know you're asleep...i can hear the soft sound of your breathing...<br>
So I get up...and I go to the window...outside...i can see all the houses...<br>
Curtains shut tight against the night...asleep beneath the roof-tiles...<br>
And as I stand here...i wonder...i wonder how many more times...<br>
I'm gonna come here...i wonder how many more times...i'm gonna lie here...<br>
And most of all...most of all I wonder...i wonder what it means...<br>
I just wanna know what it means...so I woke her...<br>
And we went walking through the sleeping town...<br>
Down deserted streets...frozen gardens grey in the moonlight...<br>
Fences...down to the canal...<br>
Creeping slowly past the cooling towers...<br>
Deserted factories...looking for an adventure...<br>
I wandered the streets calling your name...jumping walls...<br>
Hoping to see a light in the window...let me in...<br>
Let me come in...let me in tonight...<br>
Oh I see you shivering in the garden...<br>
Silver goose-flesh in the moonlight ...she's balancing...<br>
There are so many others...with unbroken eyes...<br>
No cellulite afternoons... and she is balancing...<br>
Balancing on the edge of ugliness tonight...<br>
She is balancing...</p><p class=""verse"">Good god!<br>

Maybe we...maybe we can touch the sky...do you think that we can...<br>
Do you think that we can...touch the sky...please...i know...<br>
I know it's not forever...but tonight I don't care...<br>
Your skin so pale in the moonlight...<br>
And the way your lips swell up when you're asleep...<br>
Nothing else matters...do you know how much I want you? ...<br>
Can you feel how much I want you? ...<br>

Brushed off the dust and walked away<br>

When I left her she was sat there in the bathtub crying<br>
Screaming: Jesus, I saw you on my time of dying<br>
I watched the sun cut through the sky like razor blades<br>
Oh morning, won't you come and drink the pain away<br>
Don't wanna live my life like this no more<br>
Spend my days lying awake on my bedroom floor</p><p class=""verse"">Come on, forgive me<br>
